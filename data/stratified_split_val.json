Collaboration Across Cultures Suzaku Collaboration This video talks about what happened to the original Astro-E mission. Visit the Suzaku Educational DVD page for more information on this video and to view other clips from the DVD. Suzaku was the second attempt for the Japanese and NASA to put up the Astro-E satellite.  The first attempt failed at launch in February 2000 – watch the video clip to see what happened to Astro-E. The name “Suzaku” is a Japanese god (borrowed from Chinese) represented by a vermillion phoenix.  This satellite, originally known as Astro-E2, was renamed Suzaku on the day of its successful launch.  The name signifies a new beginning for X-ray astronomy in Japan. NASA's X-ray group at Goddard Space Flight Center had been developing X-ray microcalorimeters for astronomical observations and were ready for the technology to be flown on a satellite.  A microcalorimeter was originally selected to be flown on a satellite called the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). However, in 1992, a new plan for AXAF split it into two satellites: AXAF-I would focus on high-resolution X-ray imaging and AXAF-S would perform high-resolution spectroscopy with the microcalorimeter.   AXAF-I was launched in 1999 and renamed the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  AXAF-S, however, had a different fate. In 1993, the Japanese space agency was looking for a new instrument to put on their next X-ray observatory, Astro-E.  NASA and ISAS agreed that rather than flying AXAF-S, they would collaborate, with NASA providing the primary instrument on Astro-E.  After Astro-E failed to make orbit, NASA and ISAS agreed to re-fly the satellite with NASA again providing an X-ray microcalorimeter as the primary instrument.  Upon achieving orbit, Astro-E2 was renamed “Suzaku.” A short time after launch, the X-ray microcalorimeter lost its coolant, making the instrument inoperable.  However, not all was lost – Suzaku carries two other instruments that have made many exciting discoveries. Use the links below or in the sidebar to learn more about Suzaku.

When Hubble launched in 1990, there were no confirmed planets outside of our solar system. Hubble’s unique capabilities allow it to explore planetary systems around other stars. Scientists have since established the existence of more than 5,000 extrasolar planets. Hubble’s unique contributions to the planet hunt include taking the first measurements of the atmospheric composition of extrasolar planets. Its observations have identified atmospheres that contain sodium, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, helium, and water vapor. Hubble observations demonstrate that we can detect and measure the basic organic components for life on planets orbiting other stars. TRAPPIST-1 System Illustration Hubble observed the first known system of seven Earth-sized planets around an ultra-cool dwarf star (TRAPPIST-1) that would allow liquid water to survive on four of the close-orbiting planets. All seven planets orbit closer to their star than Mercury is to our Sun and orbit very close to each other. Hubble observations suggest these planets have more compact atmospheres like those found on Earth, Venus, and Mars. Hubble delivers first hints of possible water content of TRAPPIST-1 planets This artist's concept shows what the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system may look like. NASA/JPL-Caltech Global Temperature Map of WASP-43b Astronomers used infrared data from Hubble to make a detailed global map of an exoplanet (WASP-43b) showing the temperatures at different layers in its atmosphere, and the amount and distribution of its water vapor. The white-colored region on the daytime side is 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,540°C). The nighttime-side temperatures drop below 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540°C). NASA Hubble Maps the Temperature and Water Vapor on an Extreme Exoplanet Temperature map of exoplanet WASP-43b. NASA, ESA, and K. Stevenson, L. Kreidberg, and J. Bean (University of Chicago) Fomalhaut b Dust Cloud In 2004, Hubble began regularly observing what astronomers thought might be an extrasolar planet. They studied the suspected planet for 16 years, tracking its movements around the bright nearby star Fomalhaut. However, something strange was happening as the planet appeared to dim with each successive observation. Then, in 2020, it seemed to vanish completely. Further research revealed that the suspected planet may actually be a vast, expanding cloud of dust produced in a collision between two large bodies orbiting Fomalhaut. Exoplanet Apparently Disappears in Latest Hubble Observations Fomalhaut NASA, ESA, and A. Gáspár and G. Rieke (University of Arizona) A Menagerie Hubble’s exoplanet observations reveal truly strange worlds; including one that absorbs nearly all the light that reaches it. The planet, WASP-12b, is as dark as fresh asphalt. Another, WASP-121b, is an extremely hot, football-shaped world. Hubble observations also confirmed that three super-puffy planets in the Kepler 51 system have extremely low densities. While these planets appear to be as big and bulky as Jupiter, they are actually one hundred times less massive, leading researchers to nickname them ‘cotton candy’ planets. This artist illustration depicts the three giant planets orbiting the Sun-like star Kepler 51 as compared to some of the planets in our solar system. These planets are all roughly the size of Jupiter but a very tiny fraction of its mass. NASA, ESA, and L. Hustak and J. Olmsted (STScI) The Football Shaped Planet WASP-121b orbits so close to its host star that it is on the verge of ripping apart. Its upper atmosphere reaches a blazing 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,540°C), causing magnesium and iron gas in the atmosphere to escape into space. Hubble observations of WASP-121b represent the first time astronomers detected elements more massive than hydrogen and helium escaping from a hot Jupiter-like planet. They also suggest the planet has a stratosphere, an atmospheric layer where temperature increases with higher altitudes. Hubble Uncovers a ‘Heavy Metal’ Exoplanet Shaped Like a Football This artist's illustration of WASP-121b. NASA, ESA, and J. Olmsted (STScI) A Blistering Pitch-Black Planet Hubble captured another odd, seething-hot world called WASP-12b located some 1,400 light-years away. This planet is as black as fresh asphalt and is unlike other planets in its class. WASP-12b traps at least 94 percent of the visible starlight falling into its atmosphere, heating it to 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,540°C). The planet is twice the size of any planet in our solar system and orbits so close to its host that it is tidally locked, which means the same side always faces the star. Unlike the day side, the planet’s night side is much cooler, some 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1,200°C), allowing water vapor and cloud formation. Hubble observations of the day/night boundary detected evidence of water vapor and possibly clouds and hazes in its atmosphere. WASP-12b is about 2 million miles (3 million km) away from its star and completes an orbit once a day. NASA’s Hubble Captures Blistering Pitch-Black Planet Artist illustration of WASP-12b. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) An Evaporating Planet Hubble uncovered yet another odd and elusive planet called GJ 3470b. This Neptune-sized world is roughly 3.7 million miles from its star, about one-tenth the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The planet is so close to its host star that its atmosphere is evaporating. The escaping gas forms a giant cloud around the planet that Hubble's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph detected. Researchers estimate that the planet has lost as much as 35 percent of its atmosphere over its lifetime. This isn’t the first shrinking, warm, Neptune-sized planet Hubble observed. A few years earlier, Hubble found that one of the warmest known Neptunes (GJ 436b) is also losing its atmosphere. These evaporating Neptunes may explain the existence of so-called hot super-Earths, which could form from a similar process that strips away the atmosphere of Neptune-sized planets, exposing their rocky cores. Hubble Finds a Fast Evaporating Exoplanet Artist illustration of GJ 3470b. NASA, ESA, and D. Player (STScI) Exocomets Plunging into a Young Star Hubble also detected the gaseous spectral \"fingerprints\" on a star's light of small comets plunging into the star HD 172555. The gravitational influence of a suspected Jupiter-sized planet, depicted in the foreground, may have catapulted the comets into the star located some 95 light-years from Earth. Hubble Detects ‘Exocomets’ Taking the Plunge Into a Young Star This artist illustration of exoplanets plunging toward the star HD 172555. NASA, ESA, A. Feild and G. Bacon (STScI) A young planet whirling around a petulant red dwarf star is changing in unpredictable ways orbit-by-orbit. It is so close to its parent star that it experiences a consistent, torrential blast of energy, which evaporates its hydrogen atmosphere – causing it to puff off the planet. But during one orbit observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, the planet looked like it wasn’t losing any material at all, while an orbit observed with Hubble a year and a half later showed clear signs of atmospheric loss.

Read More and Download about Hubble Focus: Strange New Worlds E-book cover for Hubble Focus: Strange New Worlds NASA Learn More New Clues to TRAPPIST-1 Planet Compositions, Atmospheres Astronomers using Hubble conducted the first spectroscopic survey of Earth-sized planets (d, e, f, and g) within the habitable zone around the nearby star TRAPPIST-1. This is a follow-up to Hubble observations made in May 2016 of the atmospheres of the inner TRAPPIST-1 planets b and c. NASA's Hubble Captures Blistering Pitch-Black Planet Hubble observed a planet outside our solar system that traps at least 94 percent of the visible starlight falling into its atmosphere, making it look as black as fresh asphalt. No Blue Skies for Super-Hot Planet WASP-79b Hubble teamed up with the Magellan Consortium's Magellan II Telescope in Chile to analyze the atmosphere of one of the largest observed exoplanets. The planet orbits a star hotter and brighter than our Sun and is some 780 light-years from Earth. Hubble Probes Extreme Weather on Ultra-Hot Jupiters Hubble studied a unique class of ultra-hot exoplanets. They are bloated Jupiter-sized worlds orbiting so close to their parent stars that their temperatures rise above 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to vaporize most metals, including titanium. Hubble Maps Temperature and Water Vapor on Extreme Exoplanet Exoplanet WASP-43b is a world of extremes where seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3,000-degree-Fahrenheit day side, hot enough to melt steel, to a pitch-black night side with plunging temperatures below 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 'Cotton Candy' Planet Mysteries Unravel in New Hubble Observations Hubble data provided the first clues to the chemistry of two of super-puffy planets located in the Kepler 51 system. Hubble Finds Planet Orbiting Pair of Stars Using Hubble, and a trick of nature, astronomers confirmed the existence of a planet orbiting two stars in the system OGLE-2007-BLG-349, located 8,000 light-years away toward the center of our galaxy. Exoplanet Apparently Disappears in Latest Hubble Observations Rather than being a full-sized planet, the planetary object could instead be a vast, expanding cloud of dust produced in a collision between two large bodies orbiting the bright, nearby star Fomalhaut. Hubble Detects ‘Exocomets’ Taking the Plunge Into a Young Star Comets outside our solar system were not directly seen around the star, but their presence was inferred by detecting gas that is likely the vaporized remnants of their icy nuclei.

Inside the Chaos of Erupting and Exploding Stars Chelsea Gohd NASA Universe Web Team Apr 03, 2025 Article Contents Different Types of Novae Novae vs. Supernovae Humans and Novae Stars — they shimmer in the night sky, burning hot across the cosmos. But sometimes … they erupt. Enter: novae. In short, a nova is an outburst in a binary system, or system with two stars that closely orbit one another. In all known novae, one of the stars in the system is a white dwarf, which is the leftover core of a star like our Sun after it runs out of fuel. Its companion will typically be either a main sequence star, a classification that includes 90% of known stars, or a large star like a red giant approaching the end of its life. Two stars, a red giant and white dwarf, orbit each other in this artist's concept of a recurrent nova. NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center In most systems that create novae, the white dwarf and its companion star orbit so closely that the white dwarf’s gravity pulls material from the companion. This material swirls around the white dwarf and forms an accretion disk. Throughout this process, the white dwarf's gravity will pull the material toward itself, depositing it onto its own surface, which while fluid in consistency is extremely hot and dense. The material pulled from the atmosphere of the companion star is primarily hydrogen. Over time, that material builds up on the surface of the white dwarf. As hydrogen accumulates, it is heated by the white dwarf, and that heat builds until it eventually triggers a fusion reaction. In other words, the gas is explosively ejected from the surface of the white dwarf. Novae are, on average, around 200,000 times as bright as the Sun, while the brightest novae can be 10 times brighter than that. Novae can even be bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye from Earth, even if the star system wasn’t visible prior to the outburst. Novae can last for days, weeks, or even months. Different Types of Novae There is variety among novae, as they can take place with different types of companion stars and can last for different amounts of time and with varying levels of brightness. However, there are two main types: classical and recurrent. Both are eruptions that take place on the surface of stars, but there are a few main differences. Classical novae erupt only once within a human lifetime. These novae will likely erupt again, but it can take thousands or even millions of years for enough material to build up on the star's surface to trigger an eruption. Recurrent novae erupt, as the name suggests, more than once. A nova is recurrent if a system has at least two recorded outbursts. Scientists are not yet sure why some novae erupt more frequently, but it could be influenced by a number of factors including the type of companion star as well as how fast the white dwarf can accumulate material pulled from the companion star. Novae vs. Supernovae You may have heard of a supernova before, but this explosive phenomenon is different from a nova. While there are multiple types, in general, a supernova is an explosive outburst that essentially destroys the star. When a nova occurs, a large outburst takes place, but the stars in the system aren’t destroyed. In core collapse supernovae, a massive star collapses in on itself and creates a shock wave that produces a bright flash of light. In another class, called Type Ia, a white dwarf gains so much material from a companion that it exceeds the mass limit for white dwarfs, resulting in a massive thermonuclear explosion. Novae always take place in binary systems. Supernovae can take place in binary systems or systems with singular stars. Also, a supernova results in an explosion much brighter than a nova. While novae can be hundreds of thousands of times as bright as the Sun, a supernova can be billions of times as bright.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab Humans and Novae Because they are so bright, novae can be visible to the unaided eye. This means that humans most likely saw novae long before telescopes were invented. From Earth, novae don't look like explosions in the sky, but rather like stars suddenly appearing or getting brighter. After erupting, novae can be visible for days or even weeks. In fact, one specific nova, called T Coronae Borealis, nicknamed \"the blaze star,\" has been observed by humans for centuries. This recurrent nova explodes about once every 80 years. It last had an outburst in 1946 and is expected to erupt again sometime in the mid-2020s. Eager astronomers have been watching carefully since about the summer of 2024. The first possible observation of this phenomenon took place in 1217, when a man in Germany named Burchard reported seeing \"a faint star that for a time shone with great light\" in the night sky. While humankind has looked up at the stars for as long as our species has existed, technology has vastly improved our ability to observe and understand novae. Scientists can use both space- and ground-based telescopes to not just identify novae, but study them in more detail. By observing novae in different wavelengths — including radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, and sometimes gamma-ray light — scientists can investigate different aspects of novae. Evolving techniques have allowed researchers to explore everything from the mechanisms behind these eruptions to their accretion disks and even the nature of the material accumulating in these outbursts.

Montana State University 2. University of Mississippi Abstract We study the performance of various analytical frequency-domain templates for detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from spin-precessing, quasicircular, compact binary inspirals. We begin by assessing the extent to which nonspinning, spin-aligned, and the new (analytical, frequency-domain, small-spin) double-precessing frequency-domain templates can be used to detect signals from such systems. For effective, dimensionless spin values above 0.2, the use of nonspinning or spin-aligned templates for detection purposes will result in a loss of up to 30% of all events, while in the case of the double-precessing model, this never exceeds 6%. Moreover, even for signals from systems with small spins, nonspinning and spin-aligned templates introduce large biases in the extracted masses and spins. The use of a model that encodes spin-induced precession effects, such as the double-precessing model, improves the mass and spin extraction by up to an order of magnitude. The additional information encoded in the spin-orbit interaction is invaluable if one wishes to extract the maximum amount of information from gravitational wave signals.

Coleman Miller View a PDF of the paper titled Golden galactic binaries for LISA: mass-transferring white dwarf black hole binaries, by Laura Sberna and 2 other authors View PDF Abstract: We study the evolution and gravitational wave emission of white dwarf -- black hole accreting binaries with a semi-analytical model. These systems will evolve across the mHz gravitational wave frequency band and potentially be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We identify new universal relations for this class of binaries, which relate the component masses to the gravitational wave frequency and its first derivative. Combined with the high precision measurements possible with LISA, these relations could allow us to infer the component masses and the luminosity distance of the source. LISA has therefore the potential to detect and characterize a virtually unexplored binary population.

They include gravitational waves (pale arcs), a near-light-speed jet that produced gamma rays (magenta), expanding debris from a kilonova that produced ultraviolet (violet), optical and infrared (blue-white to red) emission, and, once the jet directed toward us expanded into our view from Earth, X-rays (blue). Credits: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/CI Lab Download this video in HD formats from NASA Goddard’s Scientific Visualization Studio For the first time, NASA scientists have detected light tied to a gravitational-wave event, thanks to two merging neutron stars in the galaxy NGC 4993, located about 130 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra. Shortly after 8:41 a.m. EDT on Aug. 17, NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope picked up a pulse of high-energy light from a powerful explosion, which was immediately reported to astronomers around the globe as a short gamma-ray burst. The scientists at the National Science Foundation’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves dubbed GW170817 from a pair of smashing stars tied to the gamma-ray burst, encouraging astronomers to look for the aftermath of the explosion. Shortly thereafter, the burst was detected as part of a follow-up analysis by ESA’s (European Space Agency’s) INTEGRAL satellite. Swift’s Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope imaged the kilonova produced by merging neutron stars in the galaxy NGC 4993 (box) on Aug. 18, 2017, about 15 hours after gravitational waves and the gamma-ray burst were detected. The source was unexpectedly bright in ultraviolet light. It faded rapidly and was undetectable in UV when Swift looked again on Aug. 29. This false-color composite combines images taken through three ultraviolet filters. Inset: Magnified views of the galaxy. Credits: NASA/Swift NASA’s Swift, Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer missions, along with dozens of ground-based observatories, including the NASA-funded Pan-STARRS survey , later captured the fading glow of the blast’s expanding debris. “This is extremely exciting science,” said Paul Hertz, director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division at the agency’s headquarters in Washington. “Now, for the first time, we’ve seen light and gravitational waves produced by the same event. The detection of a gravitational-wave source’s light has revealed details of the event that cannot be determined from gravitational waves alone. The multiplier effect of study with many observatories is incredible.” Neutron stars are the crushed, leftover cores of massive stars that previously exploded as supernovas long ago. The merging stars likely had masses between 10 and 60 percent greater than that of our Sun, but they were no wider than Washington, D.C. The pair whirled around each other hundreds of times a second, producing gravitational waves at the same frequency. As they drew closer and orbited faster, the stars eventually broke apart and merged, producing both a gamma-ray burst and a rarely seen flare-up called a “kilonova.” “This is the one we’ve all been waiting for,” said David Reitze, executive director of the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech in Pasadena, California. “Neutron star mergers produce a wide variety of light because the objects form a maelstrom of hot debris when they collide. Merging black holes — the types of events LIGO and its European counterpart, Virgo, have previously seen — very likely consume any matter around them long before they crash, so we don’t expect the same kind of light show.” “The favored explanation for short gamma-ray bursts is that they’re caused by a jet of debris moving near the speed of light produced in the merger of neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole,” said Eric Burns, a member of Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “LIGO tells us there was a merger of compact objects, and Fermi tells us there was a short gamma-ray burst. Together, we know that what we observed was the merging of two neutron stars, dramatically confirming the relationship.” Within hours of the initial Fermi detection, LIGO and the Virgo detector at the European Gravitational Observatory near Pisa, Italy, greatly refined the event’s position in the sky with additional analysis of gravitational wave data. Ground-based observatories then quickly located a new optical and infrared source — the kilonova — in NGC 4993. To Fermi, this appeared to be a typical short gamma-ray burst, but it occurred less than one-tenth as far away as any other short burst with a known distance, making it among the faintest known. Astronomers are still trying to figure out why this burst is so odd, and how this event relates to the more luminous gamma-ray bursts seen at much greater distances. NASA’s Swift, Hubble and Spitzer missions followed the evolution of the kilonova to better understand the composition of this slower-moving material, while Chandra searched for X-rays associated with the remains of the ultra-fast jet. When Swift turned to the galaxy shortly after Fermi’s gamma-ray burst detection, it found a bright and quickly fading ultraviolet (UV) source. “We did not expect a kilonova to produce bright UV emission,” said Goddard’s S. Bradley Cenko, principal investigator for Swift. “We think this was produced by the short-lived disk of debris that powered the gamma-ray burst.” Over time, material hurled out by the jet slows and widens as it sweeps up and heats interstellar material, producing so-called afterglow emission that includes X-rays. But the spacecraft saw no X-rays — a surprise for an event that produced higher-energy gamma rays. NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory clearly detected X-rays nine days after the source was discovered . Scientists think the delay was a result of our viewing angle, and it took time for the jet directed toward Earth to expand into our line of sight. The kilonova associated with GW170817 (box) was observed by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory. Hubble detected optical and infrared light from the hot expanding debris. The merging neutron stars produced gravitational waves and launched jets that produced a gamma-ray burst. Nine days later, Chandra detected the X-ray afterglow emitted by the jet directed toward Earth after it had spread into our line of sight. NASA/CXC/E. Troja “The detection of X-rays demonstrates that neutron star mergers can form powerful jets streaming out at near light speed,” said Goddard’s Eleonora Troja, who led one of the Chandra teams and found the X-ray emission. “We had to wait for nine days to detect it because we viewed it from the side, unlike anything we had seen before.” On Aug. 22, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope began imaging the kilonova and capturing its near-infrared spectrum , which revealed the motion and chemical composition of the expanding debris. On August 17, 2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory detected gravitational waves from a neutron star collision. Within 12 hours, observatories had identified the source of the event within the galaxy NGC 4993, shown in this Hubble Space Telescope image, and located an associated stellar flare called a kilonova (box). Inset: Hubble observed the kilonova fade over the course of six days. NASA and ESA “The spectrum looked exactly like how theoretical physicists had predicted the outcome of the merger of two neutron stars would appear,” said Andrew Levan at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, who led one of the proposals for Hubble spectral observations. “It tied this object to the gravitational wave source beyond all reasonable doubt.” Astronomers think a kilonova’s visible and infrared light primarily arises through heating from the decay of radioactive elements formed in the neutron-rich debris. Crashing neutron stars may be the universe’s dominant source for many of the heaviest elements, including platinum and gold. Because of its Earth-trailing orbit, Spitzer was uniquely situated to observe the kilonova long after the Sun moved too close to the galaxy for other telescopes to see it. Spitzer’s Sept. 30 observation captured the longest-wavelength infrared light from the kilonova, which unveils the quantity of heavy elements forged. “Spitzer was the last to join the party, but it will have the final word on how much gold was forged,” says Mansi Kasliwal, Caltech assistant professor and principal investigator of the Spitzer observing program. Numerous scientific papers describing and interpreting these observations have been published in Science, Nature, Physical Review Letters and The Astrophysical Journal. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time in 2015 by LIGO, whose architects were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics for the discovery. -end- Felicia Chou Headquarters, Washington 202-358-0257 felicia.chou@nasa.gov Dewayne Washington Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. 301-286-0040 dewayne.a.washington@nasa.gov Molly Porter Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. 256-544-0034 molly.a.porter@nasa.gov Share Details Last Updated Jul 26, 2023 Related Terms Goddard Space Flight Center Chandra X-Ray Observatory Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope Jet Propulsion Laboratory Marshall Space Flight Center NASA Headquarters Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Spitzer Space Telescope Stars The Solar System Was this page helpful?

Abstract We analyse the post-inflationary contribution to the stochastic gravitational wave background due to a resonant feature in the scalar power spectrum, which is characterised by an oscillation in log(k), complementing our previous work arXiv:2012.02761 on sharp features. Primordial features signal departures of inflation from the single-field slow-roll paradigm and are motivated by embeddings of inflation in high energy physics. We find that the oscillation in the scalar power spectrum leads to a corresponding modulation in the gravitational wave spectrum that can be understood as a superposition of two oscillatory pieces, one with the original frequency of the scalar oscillations, and one with double frequency. For oscillations with slowly-varying amplitude this oscillatory part can be computed semi-analytically. Our results can be used as templates for the reconstruction of the signal from future data and permit extracting information about the small scale scalar power spectrum from measurements of the stochastic gravitational wave background.

This is largely due to the success of large-area surveys which have brought the known population of such systems in the Galactic disk to around 50. As well as being interesting as a population of astronomical sources, many pulsars turn out to be superb celestial clocks. In this review we summarise the main properties of binary and millisecond pulsars and highlight some of their applications to relativistic astrophysics.

Striking examples have been the confirmation of the existence of gravitational radiation [ 150 ] as predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity [ 146 , 147 ] and the first detection of an extra-solar planetary system [ 166 , 122 ]. Currently, many new binary systems containing neutron stars are being discovered as a result of the latest generation of pulsar surveys. This review is concerned primarily with some of the results and spin-offs from these surveys which will be of particular interest to the Relativity community. The surveys themselves have been extensively reviewed by several authors [ 92 , 27 , 28 ] to which the interested reader is referred for further details. By way of introduction, and to make the review fairly self-contained, we begin with an overview of the pulsar phenomenon (§ 2 ). This includes a brief review of the key observed population properties as well as a summary of the main theories concerned with the origin and evolution of pulsars. In § 3 , we review present understanding of the Galactic population of pulsars, discussing selection effects in the major surveys (§ 3.1 ), and techniques used to correct the observed sample (§ 3.2 ). These studies lead to robust calculations of the total number of normal and millisecond pulsars (§ 3.3 ) and neutron star binaries (§ 3.4 ) in the Galaxy and have implications for the detection of gravitational radiation from these systems. Perhaps the most important application of pulsars to relativity is the high precision science known as “pulsar timing” discussed in § 4 . Here it is seen that some pulsars are exceptional celestial clocks (§ 4.4 ). One application, a sensitive detector of long-period gravitational waves, is discussed in § 5 . Finally, in § 6 , we outline likely areas where progress may be made in the future. 2 The Pulsar Phenomenon Many of the basic observational facts about radio pulsars were established shortly after their discovery [ 65 ] by Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish in 1967. In the intervening years, theoretical and observational progress has flourished. Although there are many remaining questions, particularly about the emission mechanism, the basic model has long been established beyond all reasonable doubt viz: Pulsars are rapidly rotating, highly magnetised neutron stars formed during the supernova explosions of massive (∼ 5–10 M ⊙ ) stars. In the following, we discuss the basic observational properties most relevant to this review. 2.1 The lighthouse model The so-called “lighthouse model” used to explain the basic pulsar phenomenon is demonstrated in the animated image shown in Fig. 1 . As the neutron star spins, charged particles are accelerated out along magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere (depicted by the light blue cones). This acceleration causes the particles to emit electromagnetic radiation, most readily detected at radio frequencies as a sequence of observed pulses produced as the magnetic axis (and hence the radiation beam) crosses the observer’s line of sight each rotation. The period of the pulses is simply the rotation period of the neutron star. The position of the tracker ball on the idealised pulse profile in the animation shows precisely the relationship between observed intensity and rotational phase of the neutron star. Figure 1 mpg-Movie (146 KB) The rotating neutron star (or “lighthouse”) model for pulsar emission (For video see appendix). Full size image Neutron stars are extremely stable rotators. They are essentially equivalent to large celestial flywheels with moments of inertia ∼ 10 45 g cm 2 . The rotating neutron star model, which was independently developed by Pacini and Gold in 1968 [ 112 , 55 ] correctly predicts that the pulse period should gradually increase as the outgoing radiation carries away rotational kinetic energy. When a period increase of 36.5 ns per day was measured for the pulsar in the Crab nebula [ 124 ], Gold showed that a rotating neutron star with a large magnetic field must be the dominant energy supply to the nebula and the model became universally accepted. 2.2 Pulse Profiles Pulsars are weak radio sources. Mean flux densities, usually quoted in the literature at a radio frequency of 400 MHz, vary between 1 and 100 mJy (1 Jy = 10 -26 Wm -2 Hz -1 ). This means that the addition of many thousands of pulses is required in order to produce a discernible profile. A remarkable fact is that, although the individual pulses vary quite dramatically from pulse to pulse, at any particular observing frequency the integrated profile is very stable. The pulse profile can thus be thought of as a finger print of the emission beam. This process is demonstrated in the animation shown in Fig. 2 — a sequence of consecutive single pulses for one of the brightest pulsars PSR B0329+54 Footnote 1 . This pulsar is seen in the animation to stabilise into its characteristic 3-component form after the summation of about 10 seemingly erratic single pulses. This property is of key importance in pulsar timing measurements (§ 4 ). Figure 2 mpg-Movie (13.1 KB) Single pulses from PSR B0329+54 .(For video see appendix).

Each profile represents 360 degrees of rotational phase. These, and over 2600 other pulse profiles are available on-line [ 148 ]. Full size image 2.3 The Pulsar Distance Scale From the sky distribution shown in Fig. 4 we see straight away that pulsars are strongly concentrated along the Galactic plane, indicating that they populate the disk of our Galaxy. Figure 4 The sky distribution of pulsars in Galactic coordinates. The plane of the Galaxy is depicted by the central horizontal line with the centre of the Galaxy in the middle. Bold points denote pulsars associated with supernova remnants . Full size image Direct measurements of the distances to pulsars are notoriously difficult to obtain. There are three basic techniques: neutral hydrogen absorption, trigonometric parallax (measured either with an interferometer or through pulse time-of-arrival techniques) and from associations with objects of known distance ( i.e. supernova remnants, globular clusters and the Magellanic Clouds). Together, these provide measurements of (or limits on) the distances to over 100 pulsars. For an excellent review of these measurements and their implications, see [ 161 ]. In the absence of a direct measurement, the distances to most pulsars can be estimated from an effect known as pulse dispersion which arises from the fact that the group velocity of the pulsed radiation through the ionised interstellar medium is frequency dependent: Pulses emitted at higher radio frequencies travel faster through the interstellar medium, arriving earlier than those emitted at lower frequencies. The delay Δ t in arrival times between a high frequency ν hi (MHz) and a low one ν lo (MHz), can be shown [ 95 ] to be $$\\Delta t = 4.15 \\times {10^6}\\;{\\rm{ms}}\\; \\times \\;\\left( {\\nu _{{\\rm{lo}}}^{ - 2} - \\nu _{{\\rm{hi}}}^{ - 2}} \\right)\\; \\times \\;{\\rm{DM,}}$$ ((1)) where the dispersion measure DM (cm -3 pc) is the integrated column density of free electrons along the line of sight: $${\\rm{DM}}\\;{\\rm{ = }}\\;\\int_0^d {{n_{\\rm{e}}}} \\;dl\\;{\\rm{pc}}\\;{\\rm{c}}{{\\rm{m}}^{ - 3}}.$$ ((2)) Here, d is the distance to the pulsar (pc) and n e is the free electron density (cm -3 ). Pulsars at large distances have higher column densities and therefore larger DMs than those pulsars closer to Earth so that, from equation 1 , the dispersive delay across the bandwidth is greater. Thus, from a measurement of the delay across a finite bandwidth we infer the DM. Hence, the distance can be estimated from a model of the Galactic distribution of free electrons, n e . Taylor & Cordes [ 144 ] have developed such a model calibrated from the sample of pulsars with independently known distances plus measurements of interstellar scattering for various Galactic and extragalactic sources. The model appears to be free of large systematic trends and can be used to provide distance estimates with an uncertainty of ∼ 30%. 2.4 Normal and Millisecond Pulsars The present public-domain catalogue, available on-line at Princeton [ 121 ], contains up-to-date parameters for some 706 pulsars. Most of these are “normal” in the sense that their pulse periods are of order one second and, with few exceptions, are observed to increase secularly at rates of typically 10 -15 s/s. A growing fraction of the observed sample are the so-called “millisecond pulsars”, which have spin periods primarily in the range 1.5 and 30 ms and have rates of slowdown < 10 -19 s/s. The first millisecond pulsar discovered, PSR B1937+21 [ 6 ], with a period of 1.5578 ms, remains the most rapidly rotating neutron star presently known to man. A very useful means of demonstrating the distinction between these two classes is the “ P - P ” diagram — a logarithmic scatter plot of the observed pulse period versus the period derivative. This is shown in Fig. 5 , in which normal pulsars occupy the majority of the upper right hand part of the diagram, whilst the millisecond pulsars reside in the lower left hand part of the diagram. Figure 5 Pulse periods plotted against period derivatives for a sample of 639 pulsars. Filled red stars denote those pulsars known to be associated with supernova remnants. The blinking blue circles highlight those pulsars which are members of binary systems . Full size image The differences in P and ̇P imply different ages and surface magnetic field strengths. By treating the pulsar as a rotating magnetic dipole, one may show that the surface magnetic field strength is proportional to \\(\\sqrt {P\\dot P} \\) [ 102 ]. Lines of constant magnetic field strength are drawn on Fig. 5 , together with lines of constant characteristic age ( τ = P /(2 ̇P )). From these, one infers typical magnetic fields and ages of 10 12 G and 10 7 yr for the normal pulsars and 10 8 G and 10 9 yr for the millisecond pulsars respectively. A very important additional difference between normal and millisecond pulsars is the presence of an orbiting companion. Presently, about 7% of all known pulsars are members of binary systems. Timing measurements (§ 4 ) place useful constraints on the masses of the companions which, supplemented by observations at other wavelengths, tell us a great deal about their nature. The present sample of orbiting companions are either white dwarfs, main sequence stars, or other neutron stars. A notable additional hybrid system is the so-called “planets pulsar” PSR B1257+12 — a 6.2 ms pulsar accompanied by at least two ∼ Earth-mass bodies [ 166 , 122 ]. Orbital companions are much more commonly observed around millisecond pulsars (∼ 80% of the observed sample) than the normal pulsars (< 1%). The sample of binary pulsars is delineated in Fig. 6 as orbital eccentricity against mass of the companion. The dashed line serves merely to guide the eye in this figure. From this we note that the binary systems below the line are those with low-mass companions (< 0.7 M ⊙ — predominantly white dwarfs) and essentially circular orbits: 10 -5 < e < 0.1. The binary pulsars with high-mass companions (> 1 M ⊙ — neutron stars or main sequence stars) are in much more eccentric orbits: 0.2 > e > 0.9 and lie above the line. Figure 6 Companion mass versus orbital eccentricity for the sample of binary pulsars . Full size image The presently favoured model to explain the formation of the various types of systems has been developed over the years by a number of authors [ 21 , 49 , 138 , 1 ] and can be qualitatively summarised as follows: Starting with a binary star system, the neutron star is formed during the supernova explosion of the initially more massive star which has an inherently shorter main sequence lifetime. From the virial theorem, it follows that the binary system gets disrupted if more than half the total pre-supernova mass is ejected from the system during the explosion. In addition, the fraction of surviving binaries is affected by the magnitude and direction of the impulsive “kick” velocity the neutron star receives at birth [ 66 , 7 ]. Those binary systems that disrupt produce a high velocity isolated neutron star and an OB runaway star [ 22 ]. Over the next 10 7 yr or so after the explosion, the neutron star may be observable as a normal radio pulsar spinning down to periods of several seconds or longer. The high disruption probability explains why so few normal pulsars have companions. For those few binaries that remain bound, and in which the companion is sufficiently massive to evolve into a giant and overflow its Roche lobe, the old spun-down neutron star can gain a new lease on life as a pulsar by accreting matter and therefore angular momentum from its companion [ 1 ]. The term “recycled pulsar” is often used to describe such objects. During this accretion phase, the X-rays liberated by heating the infalling material onto the neutron star mean that such a system is expected to be visible as an X-ray binary system. Two classes of X-ray binaries relevant to binary and millisecond pulsars exist, viz: neutron stars with high-mass or low-mass companions. For a detailed review of the X-ray binary population, including systems likely to contain black holes rather than neutron stars, the interested reader is referred to [ 19 ]. The high-mass companions are massive enough to explode themselves as a supernova, producing a second neutron star. If the binary system is lucky enough to survive this explosion, it ends up as a double neutron star binary. The classic example is PSR B1913+16 [ 68 ], a 59 ms radio pulsar with a characteristic age of ∼ 10 8 yr which orbits its companion every 7.75 hr [ 146 , 147 ]. Other examples include PSR B2303+46, a 1 s pulsar with a characteristic age of ∼ 107.5 yr in a 12 day orbit [ 141 ]. Within the framework of this formation scenario, PSR B1913+16 is an example of the older, first-born, neutron star that has subsequently accreted matter from its companion. PSR B2303+46 is, on the other hand, likely to be the younger, second-born neutron star in its binary system. As we shall see (§ 3.4 ), double neutron star binary systems are very rare in the Galaxy, a direct indication that the majority of binary systems get disrupted by the exploding star. Although no such system has yet been found in which both neutron stars are visible as radio pulsars, timing measurements (§ 4.3 ) show that the companion masses are ∼ 1.4 M ⊙ — exactly that expected for a neutron star [ 135 ]. In addition, no optical counterparts are seen. Thus, we conclude that these unseen companions are neutron stars that are either too weak to be seen/no longer active as radio pulsars or their emission beams do not intersect our line of sight. The two known radio pulsars with main sequence companions may well represent the “missing link” between high-mass X-ray binaries and double neutron star systems [ 73 , 76 ]. By definition, the companions in the low-mass X-ray binaries evolve and transfer matter onto the neutron star on a much longer time-scale, spinning it up to periods as short as a few ms [ 1 ]. This model has recently gained strong support from the discoveries of kHz quasi-periodic oscillations in a number of low-mass X-ray binaries [ 162 ], as well as Doppler-shifted 2.49 ms X-ray pulsations from the transient X-ray burster SAX J1808.4-3658 [ 163 , 30 ]. At the end of the spin-up phase, the secondary sheds its outer layers to become a white dwarf in orbit around a rapidly spinning millisecond pulsar. Presently ∼ 10 of these systems have compelling optical identifications of the white dwarf companion [ 13 , 15 , 91 , 90 ]. Perhaps the best example is the white dwarf companion to the 5.25 ms pulsar J1012+5307 [ 110 , 87 ]. This 19 th magnitude white dwarf is bright enough to allow precise measurements of its surface gravity, as well as the Doppler shifts of its spectral lines as it moves in its orbit [ 159 ]. 2.5 Pulsar Velocities Pulsars have long been known to have space velocities at least an order of magnitude larger than those of their main sequence progenitors which have typical values between 10 and 50 km s -1 . The first direct evidence for this came from optical observations of the Crab pulsar 1968 [ 155 ], showing that the neutron star has a velocity in excess of 100 km s -1 . Proper motions for about 100 pulsars have subsequently been measured largely by radio interferometric techniques [ 94 , 9 , 50 , 60 ]. These data imply a broad velocity spectrum ranging from 0 to 1000 km s -1 [ 96 ]. Such large velocities are perhaps not surprising, given the violent conditions which form neutron stars. Shklovskii [ 137 ] demonstrated that, if the explosion is only slightly asymmetric, an impulsive “kick” velocity of up to 1000 km s -1 is imparted to the neutron star. As a result, a newly formed high-velocity pulsar quickly leaves its birth site close to the Galactic plane and on average it migrates to higher Galactic latitudes. This effect is seen most dramatically in Fig. 7 , a dynamical simulation of the orbits of 100 neutron stars in a model of the Galactic gravitational potential. Figure 7 mpg-Movie (213 KB) A simulation following the motion of 100 pulsars in a model gravitational potential of our Galaxy for 200 Myr. The view is side-on i.e. the horizontal axis represents the galactic plane (30 kpc across) whilst the vertical axis represents ±10 kpc from the plane. This snapshot shows the initial configuration of young neutron stars .(For video see appendix) Full size image Using the proper motion data, recent studies have demonstrated that the mean birth velocity of normal pulsars is ∼ 450 km s -1 ([ 96 , 86 , 36 , 54 ]; see, however, also [ 61 , 59 ]). This is significantly larger than the millisecond pulsars — recent studies suggest that their mean birth velocity is likely in the range ∼ 80 – 140 km s -1 [ 83 , 35 , 99 ]. The main reason for this difference surely lies in the fact that about 80% of the millisecond pulsars are members of binary systems (§ 2.4 ) which couldn’t have survived if the neutron star had received a substantial kick velocities. 2.6 Going further This section has served as an introduction to the basic aspects of pulsar astronomy relevant to subsequent sections of this review. For those wishing to delve deeper, two excellent graduate-level monographs are available: Pulsars by Manchester & Taylor [ 102 ] and Pulsar Astronomy by Lyne & Smith [ 95 ]. Those wishing to approach the subject from a more theoretical viewpoint are advised to read Michel’s The Theory of Neutron Star Magnetospheres [ 105 ] and The Physics of the Pulsar Magnetosphere by Beskin, Gurevich & Istomin [ 18 ]. Our summary of evolutionary scenarios is meant primarily as an introduction to the vast body of literature on this subject; the interested reader is referred to the excellent review by Bhattacharya & van den Heuvel [ 19 ] for further insights, as well as to recent observationally-based reviews concerning pulsar velocities [ 8 , 84 ]. A useful up-to-date list of binary and millisecond pulsar parameters is available in a recent review by Camilo [ 27 ]. The list of pulsar-related resources available on the Internet is continually becoming more extensive and useful. Some of the more relevant links known to me are contained throughout this review. Good starting points for pulsar-surfers are the pages maintained by research groups at Bonn [ 106 ], Jodrell Bank [ 70 ] and Princeton [ 121 ]. 3 The Galactic Pulsar Population Soon after the discovery of pulsars, it was realised that the observed is heavily biased towards the brighter, nearby objects and probably represents only the tip of the iceberg of a much larger underlying population [ 57 ]. The extent to which the sample is incomplete is well demonstrated by the cumulative number distribution of pulsars as a function of distance projected onto the Galactic plane shown in Fig. 8 . Here the observed distribution (solid line) is compared to the expected distribution for a uniform disk population in which there are no such selection effects (dashed line). We see that the observed sample becomes strongly deficient in terms of the number of sources for distances beyond a few kpc. This incompletion is a result of a number of different selection effects present in pulsar searches which we now discuss in some detail. Figure 8 Cumulative number of observed pulsars (solid line) as a function of projected distance from the Sun. The dashed line shows the expected distribution for a hypothetical uniform disk Galaxy with a radius of 15 kpc in which all pulsars can be seen . Full size image 3.1 Selection Effects in Pulsar Searches The most prominent selection effect at play in the observed pulsar sample is the inverse square law, i.e . for a given luminosity Footnote 2 , the observed flux density falls off as the inverse square of the distance. This results in the observed sample being dominated by nearby and/or bright objects. Beyond distances of a few kpc from the Sun, the apparent flux density of most pulsars falls below the flux thresholds S min of the a survey. Following [ 45 ], we may parameterise the survey threshold by: $${S_{{\\rm{min}}}} = \\frac{{\\beta \\;{\\rm{SN}}{{\\rm{R}}_{{\\rm{min}}}}\\;\\left( {{T_{{\\rm{rec}}}} + {T_{{\\rm{sky}}}}} \\right)}}{{G\\sqrt {{N_p}\\Delta \\nu \\;{t_{{\\rm{int}}}}} }}\\sqrt {\\frac{W}{{P - W}}} .$$ ((3)) In this expression, β is a correction factor∼ 1.3 which reflects losses to hardware limitations, SNR min is the threshold signal-to-noise ratio (typically 7–10), T rec and T sky are the receiver and sky noise temperatures, G is the antenna gain, N p is the number of polarisations observed, Δ ν is the observing bandwidth, t int is the integration time, W is the observed pulse width and P is the pulse period. It follows from this equation that the sensitivity decreases as W /( P - W ) increases. Also note that if W > P , the pulsed signal is smeared into the background emission and is no longer detectable. The observed pulse width W is in fact broader than the intrinsic value for a number of reasons: finite sampling effects; pulse dispersion, as well as scattering due to the presence of free electrons in the interstellar medium. As discussed above, the dispersive smearing scales as Δ ν/ν 3 , where ν is the observing frequency. This can largely be removed by dividing the pass-band into a number of channels and applying successively longer time delays to higher frequency channels before summing over all channels to produce a sharp “de-dispersed” profile Footnote 3 . The smearing across the individual channels, however, still remains and becomes significant at high dispersions when searching for short-period pulsars. Multi-path scattering results in a one-sided broadening due to the delay in arrival times which scales roughly as ν -4 , which can not be removed by instrumental means. Dispersion and scattering become most severe for distant pulsars in the inner Galaxy as the number of free electrons along the line of sight becomes large. The strong frequency dependence of both effects means that they are considerably less of a problem for surveys at observing frequencies > 1400 MHz [ 34 , 72 ] compared to the usual 400 MHz search frequency. An added bonus for such observations is the reduction in T sky , since the spectral index of the non-thermal emission is about -2.8 [ 81 ]. Pulsars themselves have steep radio spectra. Typical spectral indices are -1.6 [ 100 , 88 ], so that flux densities are an order of magnitude lower at 1400 MHz compared to 400 MHz. Fortunately, this can usually be compensated somewhat by the use of larger receiver bandwidths at higher radio frequencies. For example, the 1380 MHz system at Parkes has a bandwidth of 270 MHz compared to their 430 MHz system, where 32 MHz is available. In the past, the main disadvantage in surveying at high frequencies has been the sky coverage rate which scales with the solid angle of the telescope beam. The current generation of high-frequency pulsar searches at Parkes and Jodrell Bank tackles this problem by installing multi-beam receivers in these telescopes. At Parkes, a 13 beam system [ 113 ] has been installed for use in neutral hydrogen surveys. The system is also being used for pulsar searches and can cover the sky at the same rate as the recent Parkes low-frequency 430 MHz survey [ 103 , 99 ]. Together with a 4-beam system being installed at Jodrell Bank, the sensitivity of these systems is about 7 times better than previous surveys at 1400 and 1520 MHz [ 34 , 72 ] and should thus discover several hundred new pulsars. Indeed, the Parkes survey has recently begun and has already discovered over 100 new pulsars. For an update, and more information, see Fernando Camilo’s multibeam page [ 26 ]. 3.2 Correcting the observed pulsar sample In order to decouple the selection effects from the observed sample, after Phinney & Blandford and Vivekanand & Narayan [ 118 , 160 ], we define a scaling function ξ as the ratio of the total Galactic volume weighted by pulsar density to the volume in which a pulsar could be detected by the surveys: $$\\xi (P,L) = \\frac{{\\int {\\int_{{\\rm{Galaxy}}} {\\;\\sum {(R,\\;z)\\;R} } } \\;dR\\;dz}}{{\\int {\\int_{P,L} {\\;\\sum {(R,\\;z)\\;R\\;dR\\;dz} } } }}.$$ ((4)) In this expression, ∑( R, z ) is the assumed pulsar distribution in terms of galactocentric radius R and height above the Galactic plane z . Note that ξ is primarily a function of period P and luminosity L such that short period/low-luminosity pulsars have smaller detectable volumes and therefore higher ξ values than their long period/high-luminosity counterparts. This scaling function can be used to estimate the total number of active pulsars in the Galaxy. In practice, this is achieved by calculating ξ for each pulsar separately using a Monte Carlo simulation to model the volume of the Galaxy probed by the major surveys [ 107 ]. For a sample of N obs observed pulsars above a minimum luminosity L min , the total number of pulsars in the Galaxy with luminosities above this value is $${N_{{\\rm{gal}}}} \\approx \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{{N_{{\\rm{obs}}}}} {\\frac{{{\\xi _i}}}{{{f_i}}}} .$$ ((5)) Monte Carlo simulations of the pulsar population incorporating the aforementioned selection effects have shown this approximation to be reliable [ 85 ]. The factor f in this expression, known as the “beaming factor”, is the fraction of 4 π steradians swept out by the radio beam during one rotation. Thus f gives the probability that the beam cuts the line-of-sight of an arbitrarily positioned observer. A naïve estimate of f is 20%; this assumes a beam width of ∼ 10° and a randomly distributed inclination angle between the spin and magnetic axes [ 145 ]. Observational evidence suggests that shorter period pulsars have wider beams and therefore larger beaming fractions than their long-period counterparts [ 109 , 97 , 20 , 142 ]. It must be said, however, that a consensus on the beaming fraction-period relation has yet to be reached. This is shown below where we compare the period dependence of f as given by a number of models. Figure 9 Beaming fraction plotted against pulse period for four different beaming models: Tauris & Manchester 1998 (TM88; [ 142 ] ), Lyne & Manchester 1988 (LM88; [ 97 ] ), Biggs 1990 (JDB90; [ 20 ] ) and Narayan & Vivekanand 1983 (NV83 [ 109 ] ) . Full size image Adopting the Lyne & Manchester model, pulsars with periods ∼ 100 ms beam to about 30% of the sky compared to the Narayan & Vivekanand model in which pulsars with periods below 100 ms beam to the entire sky. Note that, when many of these models were proposed, the sample of millisecond pulsars was < 5; hence their predictions about the beaming fractions of short-period pulsars relied largely on extrapolations from the normal pulsars. A recent analysis of a large sample of millisecond pulsar profiles [ 80 ] suggests that the beaming fraction of millisecond pulsars lies between 50% and unity. 3.3 The Population of Normal and Millisecond Pulsars The most recent analysis to use the scaling function approach to derive the characteristics of the true normal and millisecond pulsar populations is based on the sample of pulsars within 1.5 kpc from the Sun [ 99 ]. The rationale for this cut-off is that, within this region, the selection effects are well understood and easier to quantify by comparison with the rest of the Galaxy. These calculations should give reliable estimates for the local pulsar population . The luminosity distribution obtained from this analysis is shown in Fig. 10 . These calculations lead to a local surface density of 30 ± 6 pulsars kpc -2 for luminosities greater than 1 mJy kpc 2 . Using Biggs’ [ 20 ] beaming model, the mean surface density of active pulsars with luminosities above 1 mJy kpc 2 is 156 ± 31 pulsars kpc -2 . Applying the same techniques to the sample of millisecond pulsars, and assuming a mean beaming fraction of 75% [ 80 ], the local surface density of millisecond pulsars with luminosities above 1 mJy kpc 2 is 37 ± 16 kpc -2 . Figure 10 The corrected luminosity distribution (solid histogram with error bars) derived from a sample of 84 normal pulsars within 1.5 kpc of the Sun [ 99 ] . The observed distribution is shown by the dashed line. The difference between the observed and derived distributions below 10 mJy kpc 2 highlights the severe under-sampling of low-luminosity pulsars in the observed population . Full size image These estimates of the local surface density of active pulsars allow us to deduce the likely distance to the nearest neutron star to Earth. This number is of interest to those building gravitational wave detectors, since it determines the likely amplitude of gravitational waves emitted from nearby rotating neutron stars. According to Thorne [ 151 ], currently planned detectors will be able to detect neutron stars with ellipticities greater than $${ \\in _{{\\rm{min}}}}\\; = 3 \\times {10^{ - 10}} \\times {\\left( {\\frac{P}{{200\\;{\\rm{ms}}}}} \\right)^2} \\times {\\left( {\\frac{d}{{1\\;{\\rm{kpc}}}}} \\right)^2},$$ ((6)) where P is the rotation period of a neutron star at a distance d from the Earth. For the combined millisecond and normal pulsar populations, with a surface density of 193 ± 35 pulsars kpc -2 , the nearest neutron star is thus likely to be < 40 pc. Future detections of such sources would be able to determine whether neutron stars have such ellipticities. One of the best known candidates is the nearby 5.75 ms pulsar J0437-4715 [ 74 ] which, at a distance of 178 ± 26 pc [ 130 ], is the closest known millisecond pulsar to the Earth. Integrating the local surface densities of pulsars over the whole Galaxy requires a knowledge of the presently rather uncertain Galactocentric radial distribution [ 98 , 71 ]. One approach is to assume that pulsa",

NASA, ESA, STScI, Alexa Gordon (Northwestern) Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have found a rare event in an oddball place. It's called a fast radio burst (FRB), a fleeting blast of energy that can – for a few milliseconds – outshine an entire galaxy. Hundreds of FRBs have been detected over the past few years. They pop off all over the sky like camera flashes at a stadium event, but the sources behind these intense bursts of radiation remain uncertain. This new FRB is particularly weird because it erupted halfway across the universe, making it the farthest and most powerful example detected to date. And if that's not strange enough, it just got weirder based on the follow-up Hubble observations made after its discovery. The FRB flashed in what seems like an unlikely place: a collection of galaxies that existed when the universe was only 5 billion years old. The large majority of previous FRBs have been found in isolated galaxies. FRB 20220610A was first detected on June 10, 2022, by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope in Western Australia. The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile confirmed that the FRB came from a distant place. The FRB was four times more energetic than closer FRBs. \"It required Hubble's keen sharpness and sensitivity to pinpoint exactly where the FRB came from,\" said lead author Alexa Gordon of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. \"Without Hubble's imaging, it would still remain a mystery as to whether this was originating from one monolithic galaxy or from some type of interacting system. It's these types of environments – these weird ones – that are driving us toward better understanding the mystery of FRBs.\" Hubble's crisp images suggest this FRB originated in an environment where there may be as many as seven galaxies on a possible path to merging, which would also be very significant, researchers say. \"We are ultimately trying to answer the questions: What causes them? What are their progenitors and what are their origins? The Hubble observations provide a spectacular view of the surprising types of environments that give rise to these mysterious events,\" said co-investigator Wen-fai Fong, also of Northwestern University. Though astronomers do not have a consensus on the possible mechanism behind this extraordinary phenomenon, it's generally thought that FRBs must involve some sort of compact object, like a black hole or neutron star. One extreme type of neutron star is called a magnetar – the most intensely magnetic type of neutron star in the universe. It has a magnetic field that is so strong that, if a magnetar were located halfway between Earth and the Moon, it would erase the magnetic strip on everyone's credit card in the world. Much worse yet, if an astronaut traveled within a few hundred miles of the magnetar, they would effectively be dissolved, because every atom in their body would be disrupted. Possible mechanisms involve some kind of jarring starquake, or alternatively, an explosion caused when a magnetar's twisting magnetic field lines snap and reconnect. A similar phenomenon happens on the Sun, causing solar flares, but a magnetar's field is a trillion times stronger than the Sun's magnetosphere. The snapping would generate an FRB's flash, or might make a shock wave that incinerates surrounding dust and heats gas into a plasma. There could be several flavors of magnetars. In one case, it could be an exploding object orbiting a black hole surrounded by a disk of material. Another alternative is a pair of orbiting neutron stars whose magnetospheres periodically interact, creating a cavity where eruptions can take place. It's estimated that magnetars are active for about 10,000 years before settling down, so they would be expected to be found where a firestorm of star birth is taking place. But this doesn't seem to be the case for all magnetars. In the near future, FRB experiments will increase their sensitivity, leading to an unprecedented rate in the number of FRBs detected at these distances. Hubble will play a crucial role in characterizing the environments in which these FRBs occur. Astronomers will soon learn just how special the environment of this FRB was. \"We just need to keep finding more of these FRBs, both nearby and far away, and in all these different types of environments,\" said Gordon. The results are being presented at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Albert \nEinstein died in his sleep on April 18th from complications \nof a lingering gall bladder infection. He was 76. There is no \ndoubt that this rumpled, white-haired, pipe-smoking profes­\nsor peered deeper into the nature of the universe than any \nother man. In death he joins a select few – such as Newton, \nCopernicus, Archimedes and Pythagoras – as a giant in sci­\nence whose genius changed the course of history.\n\nThe immediate outpouring of tributes to the German-born \nscientist begins to convey his place in history. President \nEisenhower said, “No other man contributed so much to the \nvast expansion of 20th century knowledge.” Moshe Sharett, \nthe Prime Minister of Israel observed, “The world has lost its \nforemost genius.” There were even eulogies behind the Iron\n\n“Genius” continued on page 4\n\n“Yardsticks” in Neighbor \nGalaxy Double Universe’s Size \n \nThe universe is twice as large as we thought says Caltech \nastronomer Walter Baade, who has now employed the giant \n200-inch glass reflecting telescope at Mount Palomar to \nconfirm the scale of the cosmos.\n\nBaade’s discovery hasn’t come from simply reading mile \nmarkers in space, of course. To properly divine the distance \nof stars and the scale of the universe, first he had to discover \nthat Nature has created more than one kind of mile marker, \nor yardstick, if you will. Until a few years ago, there was \njust one cosmic yardstick known to astronomers, and it was \nbeing used incorrectly. Oddly enough, it took the wartime \nblackouts in Los Angeles to begin setting things straight.\n\nThat first universal yardstick was discovered around the turn \nof the century. It is a type of pulsating, variable star called \na Cepheid. Henrietta S. Leavitt of the Harvard Observatory \nwas surveying the Magellanic Clouds, those junior galaxies \noutside of the Milky Way, when she noticed that brighter \nCepheids pulsed slower than dimmer Cepheids. This was \nintriguing, since for all practical purposes the stars in the \nMagellanic Clouds can be considered the same distance \nfrom Earth. It suggested that those Cepheids were offering \nup a handy relationship between their real (not just apparent) \nluminosity and their pulsation rate.\n\nIf, for example, an astronomer observes a fast-pulsating \nCepheid in our own Milky Way galaxy which appears dim \nfrom Earth, he can use Miss Leavitt’s brightness/pulsation \nrelationship to surmise that the star is actually very bright, \njust very distant. Likewise, a slowly pulsing Cepheid which \nappears bright in our sky is probably a relatively dim star that \nonly appears bright because it’s closer.\n\nThe same relationship seemed to hold with Cepheids found \nin dense star clusters, in our own Galaxy, as was discovered \nby astronomer Solon Bailey. Finally, astronomer, Harlow\n\n“Yardsticks” continued on page 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 “Yardsticks” continued from page 1\n\nShapley standardized the yardstick\nso he could map the distance of fast-\nperiod and slow-period Cepheids\nboth inside and outside globular\nclusters in the Milky Way.  \n \n“Thus a period-luminosity relation\nwas established which covered the\nwhole range of the Cepheid variation\nand which was accepted as the\nperiod-luminosity relation for the\nnext 30 years,” recalled Baade in a\nspeech at a recent award ceremony\nof the Astronomical Society of the\nPacific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Shapley’s yardstick had flaws, as the\nfamous astronomer Edwin Hubble began to discover\nmore than 20 years ago. Doctor Hubble began studying the\nstarlight from globular clusters in the Andromeda nebula, a\nsister galaxy of the Milky Way, in 1931. For some reason\nthose clusters were burning more dimly – 1.5 magnitudes\ndimmer – than their counterparts here in the Milky Way. This\nmismatch meant either the globular clusters in Andromeda are\nbasically different animals than those in our own Milky Way,\nor Andromeda must be further than originally calculated. \n \nAs chance would have it, the solution came during the\nwartime blackouts of 1943 in California. Doctor Baade took\nadvantage of the darkened skies and the power of the 100-\ninch Hooker telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory near\nLos Angeles to re-examine Andromeda’s globular clusters.\nUsing special red-sensitive photographic plates Dr. Baade\ndiscovered two populations of stars: redder, fainter “Type II”\nstars near Andromeda’s center and in its outlying halo (the\n\nP\nh\no\nt\n\no \no\nf \nt\nh\ne\n \n100-inch Hale Telescope\n\nImage credit: Mt. Wilson-Palomar Observatories\nphoto, courtesy AIP Emilio Segre Visual Archives,\nPhysics Today Collection\n\nThe telecsope that confirmed the scale of the cosmos: \nMount Palomar’s 200-inch Hale Telescope was com-\npleted in 1949.\n\nsame arrangement as in the Milky  \nWay) and bluer, brighter “Type I”  \nvariable stars located in the outer \nspiral arms as well as in abundance\nin the Magellanic Clouds. So, Dr.  \nBaade realized that there must be\ntwo populations of Cepheids – those  \nType I Cepheids more common in  \nthe disk of a galaxy and those Type  \nII Cepheids more common in the  \nglobular clusters.\n\nEach type of Cepheid, it turns out, \nhas a different way of encoding its  \nactual brightness into its pulsing \nlight. It was as if the measuring stick for one type of Cepheid \nwas measured in feet, i.e., a good old American yardstick, \nand the other was in cubits. The problem was Shapley had \ntreated them both as regular 36-inch yardsticks. \n \n“…[U]nknowingly Shapley had made a fatal step when \nhe linked the cluster-type variables to the type I Cepheids \nthrough the type II Cepheids in globular clusters and that in \nreality were are dealing with two different period-luminosity \nrelations,” explained Dr. Baade. \n \nRecently at Mount Palomar, Baade and his computer assistant \nHenrietta Swope confirmed that both types of Cepheids \nare very different stellar animals. After recalibrating his \nmeasuring sticks, Dr. Baade startled his peers in 1952 at the \nRome meeting of the International Astronomical Union by \nannouncing that Andromeda was not 800,000 light-years \naway, as Hubble thought, but 1.8 million light-years distant. \nLikewise, with the two measuring sticks sorted out, the \nuniverse we knew in 1929 to be one billion light-years wide \nhas now doubled to two billion light-years across. ♦ \nIt’s a Star! It’s a Nova! It’s Super-Nova!  \nThere’s more than one sort of “new” star in the heavens, say \nastronomers. The evidence has been building for decades that \nnovae – those stars which light up suddenly to great bright­\nness, then fade away – actually come in at least two distinct \nclasses. On one hand there are pedestrian, Clark Kent-like no­\nvae and on the other there are truly Super-Novae.\n\nThe first clue that there were super-novae lurking among the \nstars came 35 years ago by the recently deceased astronomer \nEdwin Hubble. Using his revolutionary method for measur­\ning celestial distances, he calculated that a nova observed \nin 1885 in the Andromeda Galaxy actually must have been \nabout one hundred times more luminous than any nova re­\ncently observed in our own Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nFourteen years later, in 1934, physicists Walter Baade and \nFritz Zwicky coined the term “super-nova” when they sug­\n\ngested these were not only far brighter than normal nova, but \nrare, once-in-a-millennium, events in any given galaxy. The \nmost recent super-novae in our own galaxy, they speculated, \nwere those recorded by Germanic astronomer Johannes Ke­\npler in 1604, and another seen by Danish astronomer Tycho \nBrahe in 1572.\n\nA new wrinkle to the matter was added in 1941 by astrono­\nmer Rudolph Minkowski. He split the light from 14 distant \ngalactic super-novae into their component colors and found \nthat nine of these spectrums contained no telltale lines for hy­\ndrogen (Type I) and five did (Type II). The possible reason for \nthis, speculates British cosmologist Fred Hoyle, is that in the \nsuperlative violence of their death throes, the giant stars that \nbecome supernovae might be capable of fusing hydrogen and \nhelium to forge heavier elements like carbon and iron. They \nare then, truly, not only Super, but bona fide Stars of Steel. ♦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 \nOrigin of Everything:\nHot Bang or Ageless Universe?\n\nFred Hoyle\n\nImage credit: AIP Emilio Segre Visual Archives, Clayton\nCollectionn\n\nFred Hoyle\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine a deeper mystery than the one being \naddressed recently at the meeting of the National Academy \nof Sciences in Pasadena, California: Is the universe eternal or \ndoes it have a beginning, middle and an end?\n\nThe case for an ageless, steady-state universe which forever \nlooks much as it does today was presented at the conference \nby astrophysicists Jesse L. Greenstein and physicist Wil­\nliam A. Fowler of the California Institute of Technology. \nThe steady state theory rivals the “evolutionary” theory of \nthe universe which calls on an initial brew of hot particles \nexploding at the dawn of time and making all the universe’s \nhydrogen and perhaps helium on one fell swoop.\n\nBoth theories explain – in entirely different ways – the in­\nescapable fact that the universe is expanding. This cosmic \nexpansion was first detected in 1914, when American astron­\nomer Vesto Melvin Slipher surveyed some galaxies and no­\nticed the light from most of them was “red-shifted.” This is \nessentially the broadening and reddening of the visible light \nwaves caused by the retreat of the galaxies. It’s the electro­\nmagnetic equivalent of how the wail of a retreating locomo­\ntive drops in tone as it passes by a train watcher’s ear.\n\nIn the steady-state theory the expansion comes from the con­\ntinuous bubbling up of the most basic element, hydrogen, \nfrom empty space at a rate of one particle every cubic meter \nevery 300,000 years or so. This hydrogen eventually gathers \nand condenses into stars which, through nuclear fusions in \ntheir cores, manufacture all the heavier elements. As stars \nage and die, they disperse the heavier elements around the \ngalaxies, giving rise to new stars with rocky planets around \nthem – like our own Solar System. As evidence of that pro­\ncess, Greenstein and Fowler referred to the heavy-element­\nmaking red giant stars which can be seen today in our Galaxy.\n\nAn important aspect of the steady-state is that it’s anything \nbut static, as the champion of this theory British cosmologist \nFred Hoyle, likes to point out. Hoyle compares the death­\nless universe to a river. It may appear unchanging, but there \nis plenty of movement and change under the surface. So, to \nborrow the old river saying, you can never step into the same \nuniverse twice.\n\nThen, on the other hand, there is the somewhat less rosy \n“evolutionary” theory of Russian-born American physicist \nGeorge Gamow and his colleagues Ralph Alpher and Robert \nHerman. These scientists call on the explosion and decay of \na hot ball of neutrons at the birth of the universe to create all \nthe hydrogen and some helium. These elements froze out as\n\nthe blast expanded and cooled. The first stars were made of \nonly these original elements and fused them into new, heavi­\ner elements. These, then, were dispersed through the galaxies \nas the first stars died, and led to the less-pure mixtures of ele­\nments seen in stars now.\n\nThis evolutionary theory also accounts for the retreating gal­\naxies: they are all still in flight from the power of the initial \nblast. There may be other direct evidence of the blast as well. \nAlpher and Herman have predicted that some faint residual \nheat from that initial explosion may still be glowing dimly in \nthe form of stretched-out light waves, called “microwaves,” \njust a few degrees above absolute zero. As yet, however, no \none has devised a way to detect this theoretical remnant heat.\n\nMore accessible evidence for the evolutionary universe \ncomes from Edwin Hubble’s 1929 measurements of the ve­\nlocities of galaxies beyond our own, which built on Slipher’s \nearlier discoveries. Hubble found that the more distant in \nspace a galaxy is, and therefore the closer in time to the origi­\nnal explosion, the faster they appear to be moving away from \nus. This is exactly what would be expected if there was an \nancient blast that started it all and things have been slowing \ndown ever since.\n\nThe downside to an evolutionary universe, of course, is that \nit doesn’t end happily. There’s no limitless fount of hydrogen \nas in the steady state theory. The universe has finite resourc­\nes. So it might expand forever as all the stars burn out and \nthe universe cools down to a vast, frigid stellar graveyard. \nOr the gravity of all matter might eventually pull everything \nback together again in an gigantic collapse that rebounds \nand starts the universe all over – the endlessly exploding and \ncollapsing universe described by the late Caltech physicist \nRichard Tolman.\n\nWhich theory will prevail? Only more research with bigger \nand better telescopes will tell. ♦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 “Genius” continued from page 1\n\nCurtain. Pravda described him as “A great transformer of \nnatural science.”\n\nThe true nature of Einstein’s achievements are better known \nto his colleagues and scientific progeny, who still labor to \nunderstand, test and apply his theories. There is his revolu­\ntionary re-thinking of light as not just waves but particles. \nThen his theory of special relativity, which set speed limit \nwithin the universe at that of light. Or his most famous equa­\ntion E = mc2, which dissolved the wall between matter and \nenergy. Finally, we have his space-time bending theory of \ngravitation. Taken together, Einstein’s ideas are the basis of \nall modern physics.\n\nFor the non-physicist, however, Einstein’s genius is a given, \nbut largely a mystery. The man on the street knows that such \nthings as television and the hydrogen bomb are the results \nof his work, but we scarcely grasps how it is so. We are, \nit seems, rather like the nurse at Einstein’s deathbed, who \nfailed to grasp the great man’s final words, uttered in Ger­\nman. She did not speak German. Most of us do not speak \nphysics. Instead, we sense the importance of the man indi­\nrectly and gaze like children at a parade, as his life and his \ngenius passes before us. ♦\n\nHoyle Scoffs at “Big Bang” Universe Theory\n\nBritish cosmologist Fred Hoyle has thrown down \nthe gauntlet with regards to where and when all the \nuniverse’s elements were created. In a recent radio \nbroadcast he panned a rival theory, championed by \nUkrainian-born American physicist George Gamow, \nlabeling it a ridiculous “big bang.”\n\nGamow’s Evolutionary Theory of the universe calls \non an initial stew of super-hot nuclear fusions of basic \nparticles to create all the hydrogen in the cosmos in one \nexplosive moment. The same blast then caused space to \nexpand. The ongoing expansion from that “big bang” \nis observed by astronomers today throughout cosmos.\n\nHoyle is having none of it. “It is an irrational process \nthat cannot be described in scientific terms … [nor] \nchallenged by an appeal to observation,” he has written \nregarding Gamow’s theory.\n\nFor one thing, the “big bang” requires something \nbefore the explosion. No one knows what that might \nbe. If on the other hand, the universe is eternal and stars \nare always being made and forever making heavier \nelements, as Hoyle suggests, there is no need for an \ninitial explosion. Recent advances in nuclear physics \nseem to back Hoyle’s “steady state” view, calling on the \npressures and temperatures inside stars to manufacture \nall the heavy elements seen in the cosmos today. ♦\n\nRadio ‘Ear’  \non the Universe  \nBeing Built\n\nJ\n\nodrell Bank telescope under construction\nJodrell Bank’s Mark 1 radio telescope under construction.\n\nImage credit: Jodrell Bank, University of Manchester\n\nConstruction continues for what will be Earth’s largest \nsteerable radio antenna for listening to celestial radio \nbroadcasts. The huge, 250-foot-wide metal dish of the Mark \n1 radio telescope at Jodrell Bank in England is designed \nto be a fully adjustable. This will allow astronomers to \nexplore the entire sky for radio transmissions – something \nthey cannot do today.

It consists of 86 strings of\nphoto-detectors, extending to a depth of about 2,500 meters below the glacier's surface and\ninstrumenting a cubic-kilometer of ice. The Digital Optical Module photo-detectors detect the light\nproduced by relativistic charged particles produced by neutrino interactions in or near the instrumented\nvolume of ice. IceCube is sensitive to neutrinos from all directions. As neutrinos pass through the ice, their interactions can\nleave track signatures (~km in length) in the IceCube detector array when they produce secondary muons or compact\nsignatures (cascades of ~m in extent) when they produce secondary electrons or hadrons.\nTrack events can be reconstructed with an uncertainty of less than 1 degree, while cascade events\nhave higher signal purity. IceCube triggers on signals for neutrino energies greater than ~10 GeV\n(10 10 eV) and can identify likely astrophysical neutrino events for neutrino\nenergies greater than ~50 TeV (5Ã10 13 eV) and issue alerts to the community.

Kilonovas could be precious Observing kilonovas Kilonova FAQs Additional resources A kilonova is a bright blast of electromagnetic radiation that happens when two neutron stars or a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole collide and merge. When these collisions occur, a vast amount of material is ejected from the neutron stars , the ultradense cores of massive stars that have reached the ends of their lives. This matter is rich in neutral particles called neutrons , and in this violent sea of particles around a neutron star merger, the heaviest elements of the periodic table are forged. These include gold and platinum, radioactive materials such as uranium, and the iodine that flows through our blood. In fact, many pieces of jewelry owe their existence to a kilonova-triggering event. A kilonova is the electromagnetic glow of this ejected material. It is a transient astronomical event, meaning it appears in the sky as a brief flash of light that peaks and then fades before completely disappearing.

Darach Watson Associate Professor Darach Watson is an astrophysicist at the Niels Bohr Institute. He is a leading expert in X-ray astronomy and has helped to develop our understanding of supernovas, kilonovas and gamma-ray bursts. What are kilonovas? When two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole collide and merge, they also expel a few percent of their mass. This matter is very special because it is very rich in neutrons and starts immediately to form very heavy elements. The kilonovae are the astrophysical phenomena we observe of these extremely rapid, radioactive explosions of matter, emitting most of their radiation as optical light. Why are kilonovas so interesting? The ejected matter that forms the kilonova is the origin of half of the elements in the periodic table heavier than iron, including many very interesting elements, such as the neodymium in our cell phones, the molybdenum that plants rely on as the central component in the enzyme that allows them to fix nitrogen from the air, or the iodine in our bodies. By observing kilonovas, we can detect the origin site of the elements and measure how they are formed. How does your work relate to kilonovas? We are trying to both detect new kilonovae and to decipher the observations so that we can infer the nuclear physics of how these heavy elements form and the astrophysical circumstances and fundamental particle physics interactions that enable them to be created. How do you study kilonovas? We follow up triggers from gravitational wave detectors that tell us that a merger of neutron stars has occurred and try to find its corresponding kilonova in the sky. This is enormously challenging, as they are faint and rapidly fading. So far, we have only one precious, well-monitored event. The kilonova is observed with large telescopes and monitored spectroscopically so that we can try to determine its composition, geometry and velocity. What can kilonovas tell us about the universe? We understand most of the major physical processes that make the chemical elements. Kilonovas can tell us in detail about the last unsolved piece of that puzzle: where the heaviest elements that make up our universe came from. They may also be able to tell us about the interactions of fundamental particles, such as neutrinos , in dense environments, and how matter behaves under super-extreme densities. I am also optimistic that we may be able to use kilonovae to help us measure the expansion rate of the universe , since some of them at least appear to be extremely accurate standard candles. What are some of the mysteries surrounding kilonovas currently? The biggest mystery is how the elements are formed in the merger process — what is the nuclear and particle physics required for that alchemy to occur? Observationally, we are still at something of a loss as to why our only well-studied event appeared to be spherical. This is quite different from any of the models we have and poses a real challenge. There is also good evidence for the formation of a narrow jet in the merger process that squeezes out of the merger at close to the speed of light. The origin of that jet is also still something of a mystery. Finally, we do not know how often neutron star mergers occur and on what timescales, or how much of each element they produce. These questions are key to answering the question of the cosmic origin of the elements. What's the difference between novas, supernovas and kilonovas? An illustration of the aftermath of a kilonova, the flash of light that accompanies the merger of neutron stars. (Image credit: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss) First suggested in a paper published in 1998 , kilonovas were initially referred to as  mini-supernovas or \"micronovas,\" since the radiation flashes of neutron star mergers were predicted to be between 1% and 10% as bright as those from typical supernovas . The term \"kilonova\" was coined by Brian Metzger, now a professor of physics at Columbia University, in a paper published in 2010 , with Metzger and his colleagues pointing out that although a kilonova is less powerful than a supernova, it is still 1,000 times more powerful than a standard nova. A standard nova happens when a dim stellar corpse called a white dwarf in a binary system pulls matter from a companion star, usually a red giant , causing the white dwarf to suddenly brighten to thousands of times its original luminosity . When this material accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf, it triggers a nuclear explosion that ejects stellar material. The white dwarf begins accumulating matter again from the red giant, and the process repeats. The word \"nova\" comes from the Latin for \"new\" and refers to the fact that stars erupting in novas are too faint to be seen before the sudden brightening, making them appear like new stars in the sky, according to Britannica . A Type Ia supernova is similar to a standard nova in that a white dwarf strips matter from a binary companion. But in this instance, that flow of material pushes the white dwarf over the mass limit needed to trigger a supernova and the creation of a neutron star. Type II supernovas also indicate the birth of a neutron star or a black hole. In this case, however, that occurs as the result of the collapse of the core of a massive star at the end of its lifetime. For this reason, these cosmic explosions are often called \"core collapse\" supernovas , which are more than a million times brighter than novas. Because it represents light emerging from the collision of neutron stars, a kilonova is clearly different from both a standard nova and a supernova. Yet there is a connection between kilonovas and supernovas, as kilonovas wouldn't be possible without a supernova or two happening first. What causes a kilonova? A diagram showing the evolution of a binary star system into a kilonova explosion (stage 9). Click the box in the top right corner of the image to expand full screen. (Image credit: Image and stage text: CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/P. Marenfeld, Infographic assembled in Canva by Rob Lea.) Supernovas are launched when neutron stars or black holes are created, so most kilonovas happen in systems that have experienced two supernovas birth two dense stellar remnants, though the explosive events are likely separated by billions of years. Specific supernova explosions called ultrastripped supernovas are particularly important to kilonovas because they're vital to the creation of binary systems that can birth a kilonova. These  explosive events occur when a companion star strips a neutron star progenitor star of its stellar material, resulting in less material ejected from a dying star than is seen in typical supernova blasts . Ultrastripped supernova explosions are relatively gentle compared with other supernovas. They also lack the kick velocity needed to throw the forming neutron star away from its binary companion, meaning the neutron star born in such an event can still be orbited by a relatively close companion star. At this point in the binary system's history, the newly birthed neutron star can start stripping its companion star of its outer layers, reversing the feeding process that led to the first ultrastripped kilonova. Eventually, this triggers a second ultrastripped supernova in the binary system and the creation of a second neutron star, which again ejects little material and lacks the kick velocity to throw it out of its binary system. The result is a tight binary system in which two neutron stars closely orbit each other, but a kilonova blast is still millions of years away. This spiraling happens because these neutron star binaries — and binaries containing a black hole and a neutron star — constantly emit tiny ripples in space-time called gravitational waves . The gravitational waves carry angular momentum away from the neutron stars as they orbit each other. As a result, the binary system draws in tighter as its occupants move closer, and it emits gravitational waves at higher and higher frequencies. This causes angular momentum to leak from the system faster and faster, and the neutron stars draw in more rapidly until they collide and merge. When this kind of collision happens between a neutron star and a black hole , it facilitates the growth of that black hole. When it occurs between two neutron stars, however, it creates a supermassive neutron star , which rapidly collapses to birth a new black hole. Kilonovas could be precious Scientists have long understood that the nuclear fusion processes that power stars forge the elements , beginning with the nucleosynthesis of helium from hydrogen,   the universe's lightest element. This creates elements as heavy as iron, with the most massive stars possessing a core of iron when they die in a Type II supernova and leave behind a neutron star or a black hole. The problem with this is that with 26 protons in its atomic nucleus, iron is far from the heaviest element. This is even the case when you don't include non-naturally occurring elements, like 117-proton tennessine , which can be created in the lab. This meant that the creation of common elements that are heavier than iron — like silver  ( 47 protons), gold  (79 protons)   and platinum  ( 78 protons)  —  had been something of a mystery prior to kilonova theories. Scientists thought these elements could be created via the rapid neutron-capture process, or \" -r-process ,\" but for this to proceed stably, it would require an environment absolutely flooded with free neutrons. Because neutron stars are made almost entirely of a dense soup of neutrons, during collisions, they eject around a gram of neutrons per cubic centimeter into their surroundings. This creates a neutron-rich environment around the merger in which the r-process can proceed. The r-process begins when the seed nuclei of iron are bombarded with these free neutrons, soaking them up. Stable atoms of iron, such as the isotope iron-56, have 26 protons and 30 neutrons. The excess of neutrons granted to iron by neutron capture makes the iron atoms unstable and radioactive due to a huge imbalance between protons and neutrons. This results in some of the atoms undergoing beta decay , with neutrons transforming into protons via the emission of electrons and other particles like the antimatter equivalent of neutrinos–antineutrinos. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus, so this process transforms iron into heavier elements, like gold, in what is almost a form of cosmic alchemy. It is the radiation from the decay of the radioactive elements created during the r-process that makes the material ejected from the neutron stars glow , and it's this light that's called a kilonova. Consequently, to understand kilonovas, we must study the creation of heavy elements. Kilonovas can be identified by their unique observational signature, according to the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , with these events brighter at near-infrared wavelengths than in visible light. The difference in brightness at these wavelengths is due to the heavy elements ejected by the kilonova, which block visible light while simultaneously allowing the longer-wavelength infrared light to pass through unimpeded. This means observing kilonovas from Earth is very difficult because only a handful of telescopes, such as the twin Gemini telescopes, are sensitive enough at near-infrared wavelengths to detect these events. Have we observed any kilonovas? The Hubble Space Telescope spotted a kilonova for the first time in August 2017. (Image credit: NASA and ESA. Acknowledgment: A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), and A. Fruchter and O. Fox (STScI)) Mergers between neutron stars and collisions between black holes and neutron stars are responsible for a range of emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum , such as fast radio bursts , short gamma-ray bursts and an X-ray glow. These can be used to locate the violent event that created them, which astronomers use to hunt kilonovas or their afterglow. Early suspected kilonova detections in 2009 and 2013 were associated with short gamma-ray bursts. Gravitational waves can also be useful in tracking down kilonovas. When spiraling neutron stars finally collide and merge, this creates a sudden blast of gravitational waves that can be detected when they finally reach Earth. These gravitational waves travel at the speed of light , just like electromagnetic radiation. So when a gravitational wave detector, like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), detects gravitational waves from a neutron star merger or a merger between a black hole and a neutron star, astronomers can follow this up to try catching the kilonova in action. This worked to great effect in August 2017, when LIGO and its fellow gravitational wave detector Virgo detected gravitational waves from a merger of neutron stars located 130 million light-years from Earth. Within 12 hours, the source of the gravitational wave signal  — designated GW170817 — was found to be the galaxy NGC 4993 , and it was revealed that the kilonova resulting from the merger had been spotted in observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope . GW170817 was the first event to be \"heard\" in gravitational waves and \"seen\" with electromagnetic radiation. In 2022, a team of astronomers spotted what could be a kilonova afterglow that occurred around 3.5 years after the collision and merger of the two neutron stars that created the gravitational wave signal GW170817. This was the result of an X-ray jet from the merger expanding and slowing but leaving behind an X-ray glow with constant brightness. Astronomers aren't always chasing kilonovas, however; sometimes, they are way ahead of these powerful flashes of light. In early 2023, astronomers saw, for the first time, what they think is a system that is destined to birth a kilonova. The kilonova progenitor system CPD-29 2176 is located 11,400 light-years away and contains two tight, binary objects: a neutron star created in an ultrastripped supernova, and a Be star that the neutron star is stripping of its outer layers and that will eventually become a neutron star via the same process. It will be some time before the second star triggers one of these rare cosmic explosions. The discoverers of the system told Physics World that the Be star will take millions of years to detonate in an ultrastripped supernova. Even after that, it will take the two neutron stars in the CPD-29 2176 system billions of years to spiral together and merge. The rarity of kilonovas means this progenitor system is a \"one-in-ten-billion\" observation, its discoverers said in a statement . As astronomers study kilonovas, these cosmic blasts of light present unexpected qualities that scientists are only just beginning to investigate. For example, in February 2023 , scientists found that the kilonova blast associated with GW170817 appears to take on a perfectly spherical shape . This finding contrasts with all previous models, which suggested that two colliding neutron stars orbiting each other 100 times a second should create an explosion in the shape of a flattened disk. This means kilonovas may be hiding some hitherto undiscovered physics. Kilonova FAQs What causes a kilonova? Kilonovas are bursts of electromagnetic radiation that result from the radioactive decay of iron atoms in material ejected when two neutron stars smash together or when a neutron star merges with a black hole. Can we see kilonovas? Yes, we can see kilonovas with telescopes if we know where to look. Neutron star collisions generate gravitational waves, which can be measured on Earth . Astronomers can then attempt to follow up on these detections with telescopes to spot kilonovas. Unfortunately, gravitational wave detectors aren't good at locating the source of the ripples in space-time they \"hear.\" That means scientists have made only one observation in both gravitational waves and light thus far: the neutron star merger in the galaxy NGC 4993, which was then seen as a kilonova by the Hubble Space Telescope. What's the difference between novas, supernovas and kilonovas? All three explosive outbursts of light are caused by different events. Novas are the weakest, with outputs millions of times dimmer than supernovas. Kilonovas are the next strongest, with outputs thousands of times more powerful than novas but still between 10 and 100 times less powerful than supernovas. How are neutron stars connected to the creation of gold? The environment around neutron star collisions is rich with free neutrons, which can facilitate a form of nucleosynthesis called the rapid neutron capture process, or r-process. Elements heavier than iron can be created by the r-process when iron, the heaviest element that can be forged by stars, soaks up free neutrons and transforms into other, heavier elements. Additional resources A NASA Goddard simulation shows how gravitational wave frequencies increase as neutron stars spiral together and finally merge, resulting in a kilonova. Kilonovas can also happen when neutron stars meet black holes. A video from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics shows how one of these mixed mergers would proceed. The U.S. Department of Energy explains nucleosynthesis in greater detail. Bibliography L-X. Li., B.

Andersona, R.E. Samuelsona,c\n\na NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA\nb Universities Space Research Association (USRA), Columbia, MD, USA\nc University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA\n\nA R T I C L E I N F O\n\nKeywords:\nIces\nInfrared spectroscopy\nTitan\nAtmosphere\nClouds\n\nA B S T R A C T\n\nWe have conducted a comprehensive study of propionitrile (C2H5CN) ice from the amorphous to crystalline\nphase in order to provide detailed information on this specific cyanide, which may potentially contribute to the\nchemical composition of the Haystack ice cloud observed in Titan's stratosphere by the Cassini Composite\nInfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS). Infrared transmission spectra of thin films of pure propionitrile ices deposited at\nlow temperature (30–160 K) were collected from 50 cm−1 to 11,700 cm−1 (200–0.85 μm). The far-infrared\nspectral region was specifically targeted to compare with CIRS far-infrared limb spectra. The temperature and\ntime evolution of C2H5CN ice was thoroughly investigated to better understand discrepancies reported in pre-\nviously published laboratory studies on the crystalline phase of C2H5CN. Specifically, we observe peculiar\ntemperature and time-driven ice phase transitions, revealed by significant spectral variations in the ice, which\nstabilizes once a complete crystalline phase is achieved. From these results, the crystalline phase of propionitrile\nice was identified at deposition temperatures greater than or equal to 135 K and < 140 K. Our findings corro-\nborate previous studies that ruled out pure propionitrile ice as the sole chemical identity of Titan's observed\nHaystack emission feature. In order to understand and identify the Haystack cloud, we have initiated co-de-\nposition experiments that incorporate mixtures of Titan-relevant organics, many of which have corresponding\nvapors that are abundantly present in Titan's stratosphere. In this paper, we present the result of one example of\na co-deposited ternary ice mixture containing 16% hydrogen cyanide (HCN), 23% C2H5CN, and 61% benzene\n(C6H6). Although this co-condensed ice mixture is the best fit thus far obtained to match the broad width of the\nHaystack, it is still not the appropriate chemical candidate. However, it reveals an intriguing result: the strong\nlattice mode of pure C2H5CN ice is drastically altered by the surrounding molecules as a result of mixing in a co-\ncondensed phase. The laboratory results reported here on propionitrile ice may help to further constrain the\nchemical identification of Titan's stratospheric Haystack ice cloud, as well as improve on the current state of\nknowledge of Titan's stratospheric ice cloud chemistry.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nPropionitrile (C2H5CN), also known as ethyl cyanide or propaneni-\ntrile, is an aliphatic saturated mononitrile, proposed to form in Titan's\natmosphere in the vapor phase from two different neutral-neutral re-\nactions: (1) the combination of the excited-state of the nitrogen atom N\n(2D) with propene (C3H6) in a similar formation pathway as that of\nacetonitrile (CH3CN) (Krasnopolsky, 2009; Vuitton et al., 2007), and\n(2) the direct reaction of the CH2CN radical with the CH3 radical\n(Loison et al., 2015). Likewise, laboratory simulations of Titan's atmo-\nspheric chemistry have also been predicting the production of gaseous\nC2H5CN in Titan's atmosphere for nearly two decades (Coll et al., 1999;\n\nFujii and Arai, 1999; Thompson et al., 1991). However, it was not until\nearly in the Cassini mission when in-situ measurements made by the Ion\nand Neutral Mass spectrometer (INMS) were used to infer the presence\nof gaseous C2H5CN in Titan's upper atmosphere at altitudes > 500 km,\nwith a derived mole fraction of 5.0 × 10−7 at 1100 km, 74°N (Vuitton\net al., 2007; Vuitton et al., 2006). Vuitton et al. (2006) postulated that\nprotonation of C2H5CN may produce the molecular ion C2H5CNH+, in\nwhich they attributed the April 2005 INMS detection of the mass-to-\ncharge ratio of 56 (Waite et al., 2005; Cravens et al., 2006) to that of\nC2H5CNH+. Shortly afterwards, Magee et al. (2009) analyzed the\nINMS-measured ion masses between 50 and 56 and determined a\nC2H5CN mixing ratio of 1.54 × 10−7 at 1050 km, which is roughly a\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.05.003\nReceived 31 October 2018; Received in revised form 24 April 2019; Accepted 1 May 2019\n\n⁎ Corresponding author at: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Astrochemistry Laboratory (Mail Code 691), 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA.\nE-mail address: delphine.nnamvondo@nasa.gov (D.

(2006). Later on,\nAtacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) ground-based\nobservations were used to estimate trace amounts of C2H5CN vapor in\nTitan's stratosphere, with abundances about 200 to 600 times smaller\nthan those previously derived from Cassini INMS measurements\n(Cordiner et al., 2015). Specifically, Cordiner et al. (2015) determined\ngaseous C2H5CN mixing ratio estimates of 1.30 × 10−9 at an altitude of\n292 km, 3.24 × 10−9 at 200 km, and 0.79 × 10−9 at 100 km. These\nderived mixing ratios are similar to those previously reported by\nMarten et al. (2002), in which ground-based measurements using the\nIRAM 30-m telescope were used to estimate a C2H5CN mixing ratio\nupper limit of 2.0 × 10−9 at an altitude of 300 km. Cassini Composite\nInfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) disk-viewing (emission angles < 60°) far-\ninfrared spectra were then utilized by de Kok et al. (2008) to estimate a\nC2H5CN gas mixing ratio upper limit of 8 × 10−9 at latitudes poleward\nof 70°N in Titan's late northern winter season. More recently, the 1D\nphotochemical model of Loison et al. (2015) estimated higher mole\nfractions of gaseous propionitrile in Titan's stratosphere, with mixing\nratios more similar to those deduced by INMS, and derived a lower\nmole fraction of ~3 × 10−7 around 200 km and a larger value of\n~7 × 10−7 near 100 km; they also predicted a C2H5CN gas enrichment\nin Titan's polar regions. However, a lower abundance of C2H5CN gas is\nexpected in Titan's lower stratosphere compared to that at higher alti-\ntudes, assuming a formation scenario consistent with the production of\ngaseous propionitrile in Titan's upper atmosphere, which will diffuse to\nlower altitudes, with atmospheric loss resulting from condensation and\nchemistry in Titan's lower stratosphere (Sagan and Thompson, 1984).\nEven though C2H5CN gas is expected to condense in Titan's lower\nstratosphere, as is the case for many other nitriles, i.e. HCN, cyanoa-\ncetylene HC3N, cyanogen C2N2 (Sagan and Reid Thompson, 1984; Frère\net al., 1990; Raulin and Owen, 2002; Anderson et al., 2016, 2018b),\nC2H5CN ice has never been detected by Cassini CIRS or the Visible and\nInfrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) at any time over Cassini's\n13 year mission. Yet, its presence as a chemical component of one of\nTitan's observed stratospheric ice clouds has been debated over the last\nfour decades. This debate started after the Voyager 1 flyby of Titan in\n1980, when the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer and Radiometer\n(IRIS) recorded thermal infrared (IR) spectra of Titan's north polar hood\nnear 70°N, and discovered an intense broad emission feature centered\nat 221 cm−1 in the lower stratosphere near an altitude of 121 km\n(Samuelson, 1985). Spanning both Voyager and Cassini epochs, this\nchemically unidentified 221 cm−1 emission feature has been referred to\nby names such as Titan's 220 cm−1 feature (Samuelson, 1985, 1992),\nthe 200–240 cm−1 feature (Samuelson et al., 1997), unidentified fea-\nture 2 (Coustenis et al., 1999), Haze B (de Kok et al., 2007), the far-\ninfrared 220 cm−1 cloud (Jennings et al., 2012a), the far-infrared haze\n(Jennings et al., 2012b), the polar condensate cloud (Jennings et al.,\n2015), and the Haystack (Anderson et al., 2014). Hereafter, we refer to\nTitan's 221 cm−1 stratospheric ice emission feature as the Haystack.\nThe Haystack was initially thought to form via vapor condensation\nprocesses, and was expected to contain a single pure condensed che-\nmical compound. Initially, the Haystack was thought to be comprised of\nwater (H2O) ice due to the very strong spectral feature of H2O ice lo-\ncated\nnear\n221 cm−1\n(Samuelson,\n1985).\nSubsequent\nlaboratory\ntransmission spectra of H2O ice between 70 and 150 K, in both the\namorphous and crystalline phase, do not spectrally match the shape of\nthe Haystack ice emission feature; and consequently, H2O ice was ruled\nout early on as a candidate for the Haystack (Samuelson, 1992;\nCoustenis et al., 1999; Samuelson et al., 2007).\nThe next proposed chemical candidate for the Haystack was C2H5CN\nice due to its C–C ≡N (ν13) bending mode near 221 cm−1. Dello Russo\nand Khanna (1996) were the first investigators to initiate a detailed\nlaboratory study focusing on C2H5CN ice related to Titan's observed\nstratospheric ice clouds. They performed thin ice film transmission\nspectroscopy and reported spectra and optical constants for crystalline\nC2H5CN ice at 35 K and 95 K. In their study, the crystalline phase of\n\npropionitrile was achieved by depositing the vapor at low temperature\n(between 50 and 100 K; the exact temperature is not documented), and\nthen warmed to 140 K and annealed for 30–180 min (the exact an-\nnealing time duration is not given); and finally, they cooled the an-\nnealed sample to 95 K then to 35 K to record its IR spectrum at both\ntemperatures. The investigators reported that the laboratory spectra of\nannealed crystalline C2H5CN ice exhibited a strong absorption band (ν13\nC-C ≡N bending mode) at 226 cm−1 at 35 K and at 225 cm−1 at 95 K,\nwhich was spectrally shifted by 5 to 4 cm−1, respectively, to higher\nenergies than that of the IRIS-observed Haystack feature. As a result,\nC2H5CN ice was ruled out as a possible candidate for the Haystack\nemission feature. Dello Russo and Khanna (1996) also pointed out that\nthe wavenumber position of the C2H5CN lattice band was significantly\ndependent on temperature. In fact, nine years later, Khanna (2005a)\nreexamined the Dello Russo and Khanna (1996) results, and reported a\nshort laboratory work exclusively focused on crystalline propionitrile.\nKhanna (2005a) reassessed the laboratory IR spectra of crystalline\npropionitrile by varying the annealing temperature and duration, con-\nsidering that in the previous analysis by Dello Russo and Khanna\n(1996), they were unsuccessful in attaining the most stable crystalline\nphase of C2H5CN. Khanna (2005a) obtained a new crystalline sample\nafter depositing the vapor at 60 K, then annealing at 120 K for 4 h (and\nthen cooled back down to various temperatures, as low as 15 K), which\nrevealed the ν13 band peaking at 221 cm−1. Even though this result\ncontradicted the previous results from the Dello Russo and Khanna\n(1996) study, Khanna (2005a) concluded that condensed C2H5CN is the\npredominant contributor to Titan's Haystack emission feature, with\nminor contribution from both HC3N and H2O ices. Khanna (2005a) also\nnoted additional spectral discrepancies from their earlier work for other\nC2H5CN bands (i.e. at 547 cm−1 and at 780 cm−1), which could result\nfrom temperature dependences that may alter the peak positions and\nwidths of these two bands. However, no further study was performed to\nunderstand such discrepancies.\nNext, Moore et al. (2010) reported the IR spectra of numerous nitrile\nices from 30 cm−1 to 5000 cm−1. The investigators observed the ν13\nband of crystalline C2H5CN ice spectrally peaking at 220.9 cm−1, ob-\ntained under similar experimental conditions as that of Dello Russo and\nKhanna (1996), with deposition and annealing temperatures at 50 K\nand 140 K, respectively, and a 90 min annealing duration (see Table 1).\nFinally, a recent study of crystalline propionitrile ice particles gener-\nated under simulated Titan temperature and pressure conditions by\ncollisional cooling in an optical cell cooled to 95 K, 110 K and 130 K\n(Ennis et al., 2017), reported the ν13 band centered at 226 cm−1 for the\nthree temperatures studied, which is in agreement with the work of\nDello Russo and Khanna (1996), and thus inconsistent with the\n221 cm−1 spectral peak of the Haystack emission feature. Couturier-\nTamburelli et al. (2018a) focused their C2H5CN ice study in the mid-IR\nregion (650–5000 cm−1; 15.4–2.0 μm) and therefore did not report\nresults for the ν13 bending mode of the crystalline propionitrile ice that\nthey obtained in laboratory. Table 1 summarizes the Titan-relevant\nlaboratory works conducted for propionitrile ice over the last two\ndecades.\nThe results obtained from laboratory measurements carried out up\nuntil now are generally in agreement that the ν13 band of propionitrile\ndoes not reproduce the spectral width and strength of the Haystack\nemission feature. Additionally, some of these works find that propio-\nnitrile ice is also a poor candidate for the Haystack due to the presence\nof the strong lattice vibrations of pure C2H5CN ice between 86 and\n140 cm−1 (Dello Russo and Khanna, 1996), which are not visible in\nCIRS far-IR spectra (de Kok et al., 2007; Samuelson et al., 2007). de Kok\net al. (2008) also report that a mixing ratio of at least 1 × 10−6 for\nC2H5CN gas is necessary if the Haystack's composition strictly contained\npropionitrile ice, formed via the condensation of its vapor; this mixing\nratio requirement is about three orders of magnitude higher than the\nALMA-observed amount of propionitrile vapor in Titan's stratosphere\n(Cordiner et al., 2015).\n\nD. Nna-Mvondo, et al.\nIcarus 333 (2019) 183–198\n\n184\n\nAs noted above, previous laboratory works of propionitrile ice,\nespecially for the crystalline phase, are inconsistent in the spectral\nposition assignment of the ν13 bending mode of crystalline propionitrile\nice, with a frequency shift in the band position up to 5 cm−1. This may\nbe indicative of the non-reproducibility of the transmission spectro-\nscopy results, which may arise from variable experimental conditions\nbut more likely, this is a result of a poor understanding of its phase\nbehavior due to incomplete studies of the ice evolution with tempera-\nture and time. For example, in the previous experimental studies on\npropionitrile, we observe a discrepancy in the annealing temperature\nand annealing time duration necessary to achieve its crystalline phase\n(see Table 1). While both Moore et al. (2010) and Dello Russo and\nKhanna (1996) annealed propionitrile ice at 140 K but with different\nannealing time durations (90 min and 30–180 min, respectively), the\nstudy by Khanna (2005a) annealed the ice at 120 K for 4–5 h. These\nexperimental discrepancies raise concerns about the correct crystalline\nphase of C2H5CN ice. Spectral variabilities observed in the experimental\nresults also affects the optical constants of the ice being studied, i.e. the\nreal (n) and imaginary (k) parts of the complex refractive indices, which\nare needed for radiative transfer fits to Titan's observed spectra.\nTherefore, in order to accurately determine the potential role of\npropionitrile in the formation and composition of Titan's stratospheric\nice clouds, particularly the chemically unidentified Haystack emission\nfeature, along with the known discrepancies from all previous propio-\nnitrile ice laboratory works, we found it necessary to carry out a\ncomprehensive study on this cyanide. We also briefly discuss the sig-\nnificance of our ongoing co-deposition experiments, in which we are\nnow investigating the spectral behavior of propionitrile ice when it\nbecomes part of a two-compounds (binary) and/or three-compounds\n(ternary) co-condensed mixture. These co-condensed ice studies are\nnecessary since (1) Titan's CIRS-observed stratospheric ice clouds ap-\npear to contain ice mixtures that result from co-condensation, as op-\nposed to strictly layered with single, pure chemical compounds\n(Anderson and Samuelson, 2011; Anderson et al., 2016, 2018a, 2018b),\nand (2) we must examine if the low energy bands of propionitrile ice\nbecome altered by the surrounding molecules when mixing occurs.\nIndeed, using HCN ice as an example, we have found that its strong\n\nlibrational lattice mode is suppressed when HCN is mixed with pre-\nvailing C2N2 in the co-condensed ice (Anderson et al., 2018a).\n\n2. Experimental method\n\n2.1. Sample preparation and purification\n\nSimulating Titan's stratospheric ice cloud environment in the la-\nboratory requires forming Titan ice analogs with high purity and free of\noxygen-bearing components. The propionitrile we used in this Titan ice\nstudy was purchased as liquid, and although its purity is certified as\n99.98%, it still needs to be purified from air contaminants, such as\nwater from atmospheric humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2), prior to\nthe onset of experiments. The presence of any impurity in a sample will\nalter the spectral features of the Titan ice analog, which ultimately\nyields incorrect refractive indices. Purifying the sample then becomes\ncrucial. Unfortunately, most of the published laboratory work focused\non Titan's stratospheric ice analogs contains relative degrees of im-\npurities, with little effort dedicated to sample purification. For example,\nin the C2H5CN ice experiments of Khanna (2005a), the investigator did\nnot perform purification on the purchased liquid propionitrile and H2O\ncontamination was detected in the resulting absorbance spectra.\nMoreover, in the IR spectra of Ennis et al. (2017) collected for C2H5CN\nice particles (generated from the purchased liquid C2H5CN), the pre-\nsence of both CO2 and formic acid was visible, in which the former was\nintroduced as an impurity in the dry N2 gas bath, while the latter was\npresent as an adsorbed remnant from previous enclosive flow cooling\n(EFC) cell experiments. As well, the Ennis et al. spectra contain traces of\nacetonitrile, introduced via absorption on the EFC cell or the deposition\nline walls. In this present work, we provide laboratory IR absorbance\nspectra, along with their corresponding refractive indices, of highly\npurified amorphous and crystalline propionitrile ices.\nPropionitrile (Fluka, 99.98%) used in this present study was purified\nby freeze-pump-thaw cycling under vacuum using a cold bath at\n−116 °C (157 K) made from a mixture of ethanol (C2H5OH) and liquid\nnitrogen (LN2). As mentioned above, purification is critical in order to\nremove air contaminants, predominantly H2O and CO2, as well as other\n\nTable 1\nSummary of laboratory experiments of propionitrile (C2H5CN) ice for the study of Titan's stratospheric ice clouds.\n\nC2H5CN\nIce phase\nExperimental conditions\nSpectral range\nPublished work\n\nCrystalline\nDeposition temperature: 50–100 K\nAnnealing: 30–180 min at 140 K\nPost-cooling: 35 K, 95 K\n\n80–5000 cm−1\nDello Russo and Khanna (1996)\nDello Russo (1994)\n\nDeposition temperature: 60–80 K\nAnnealing: 4–5 h at 100–120 K\nPost-cooling: 15 K, 50 K, 80 K\nPost-warming: 150 K, 160 K\n\n200–7800 cm−1\nKhanna (2005a)\n\nDeposition temperature: 50 K\nAnnealing: 90 min (mid-IR) at 140 K\n92 min (far-IR) at 140 K\nPost-cooling: 20 K, 35 K, 50 K, 75 K\n95 K, 110 K\n\n30–5000 cm−1\nMoore et al.

After purification, the pure C2H5CN sample\nwas transferred in vacuo to a 42 ml leak-tight vacuum Schlenk glass\ntube equipped with a variable leak valve, then frozen at −196 °C (77 K)\nunder a LN2 bath, and finally stored inside a −86 °C (187 K) freezer.\nThe purity of propionitrile was inspected in the resulting mid-IR ab-\nsorbance ice spectra after vapor deposition at 30 K and 110 K by looking\nfor any impurity absorption bands. Example C2H5CN absorbance\nspectra are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, demonstrating the need for several\nfreeze-pump-thaw cycles under vacuum with a C2H5OH/LN2 cold bath\nto totally remove the CO2 and H2O contaminants (and other trace im-\npurities) from the C2H5CN sample.\n\n2.2. Acquisition of the infrared spectra of propionitrile thin ice films\n\nAll\npropionitrile\nexperiments\nwere\nconducted\nusing\nthe\nSPECtroscopy of Titan-Related ice AnaLogs (SPECTRAL) ice chamber\n(Fig. 3), located in the Spectroscopy for Planetary ICes Environments\n(SPICE) laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The\ndetailed description of the SPECTRAL ice chamber, along with the\nstandard experimental methodology for vapor deposition and data\nanalysis utilized here, are given in Anderson et al. (2018a).\nIn this present work, we have performed thin film transmission\nspectroscopy of the amorphous to crystalline phases of pure propioni-\ntrile ice, from the far- to near-IR spectral region (50–11,700 cm−1;\n200–0.85 μm), as functions of temperature and time. As well, we have\ndetermined their corresponding optical constants. The spectra were\ncollected under a vacuum of 8 × 10−8 mbar at low deposition tem-\nperatures, ranging from 30 K to 160 K. For each spectrum, 256 scans\nwere\naveraged\nat\na\nspectral\nresolution\nof\n4 cm−1.\nThe\nFTIR\n\nspectrometer has three different beamsplitter/detector combinations\ndepending on the spectral range in which the spectra are acquired. For\nthe far-IR spectral region (50–700 cm−1; 200–14.3 μm), a DTGS de-\ntector with a polyethylene window is combined with a solid substrate\nbeamsplitter.\nFor\nthe\nmid-IR\nspectral\nregion\n(600–8000 cm−1;\n16.7–1.25 μm) a MCT-A detector with a KBr beamsplitter is used. For\nthe near-IR spectral region (1000–11,700 cm−1; 10–0.85 μm), the MCT-\nA detector is coupled to a CaF2 beamsplitter using the white light source\n(an IR source is used for the far- and mid-IR spectral regions). When\ncollecting the mid-IR spectra of propionitrile ice, the FTIR spectro-\nmeter's gain and aperture size were first optimized in the mid-IR to\nreduce the intensity of the CVD diamond absorption bands arising from\nthe sample substrate and chamber windows. This correction is neces-\nsary since CVD diamond strongly absorbs between 2300 cm−1 and\n2000 cm−1.\nPrior to vapor deposition, background spectra were collected for\neach selected temperature. Ice absorbance spectra were then recorded\nafter they were automatically background corrected, which takes the\nratio between the individual ice and background spectra, thus removing\nspectral features introduced by the spectrometer and also the atmo-\nspheric gases. This procedure provides a final ice absorbance spectrum\nwith peaks arising solely from the ice sample. The baseline of this final\nIR ice absorbance spectrum contains channel fringes, which are pro-\nduced by the reflections at the vacuum-ice and ice-substrate sample\nsurface (Hirschfeld and Mantz, 1976). The channel fringes behave\nsomewhat like a sinusoidal waveform, with the ice spectral features\nsuperimposed. Prior to the calculation of the real and imaginary parts of\n\nFig. 1.

When re-\nmoving the channel fringes from all spectra acquired, we purposely set\nup the absorbance value to zero in the Far-IR region for frequencies\nbelow 55 cm−1 when the signal-to-noise (S/N) becomes low (S/N < 3)\nand the peaks cannot be accounted as real absorption bands. Once the\nspectra are channel fringe corrected, the optical constants n and k are\nthen computed using a custom-developed IDL program which uses the\nBeer-Lambert law and applies an iterative Kramers-Kronig analysis of\nthe laboratory corrected absorbance spectra (see Anderson et al., 2018a\nfor the data processing details). The absorbance spectra and optical\nconstants are available on the SPICE laboratory website at https://\nscience.gsfc.nasa.gov/691/spicelab.\nAt room temperature (295 K), propionitrile has a saturation vapor\npressure of 53 mbar. As a result, vapors of pure propionitrile were then\neasily obtained at saturation equilibrium from the purified liquid phase\n(stored in the closed sample Schlenk tube) evaporated at room tem-\nperature. Pure C2H5CN gas was then flowed through two stainless steel\ngas deposition lines into the spherical sample compartment of the\nSPECTRAL chamber at a flow rate of 4.2 ml/min, and then slowly\ncondensed onto a diamond substrate at the desired low temperature,\nwith an ice deposition rate of 0.35 μm/min. Warming and cooling rates\nof the diamond substrate on which the ice deposits were about\n3 K min−1. The cooling/heating of the diamond substrate inside the\nsample chamber is performed by a close cycle cryostat which contains a\ncryocooler connected to an air-cooled helium compressor. The tem-\nperature is controlled by a temperature controller connected to the\ncryocooler, a 36 Ohm internal resistive Thermofoil heater and two si-\nlicon diodes (uncalibrated temperature sensors; accuracy ± 0.5 K from\n2 K to 305 K) located on the holder of the diamond substrate (see more\n\ndetails in Anderson et al., 2018a). The thicknesses of the ice films were\ndetermined by double laser interferometric technique (detailed in\nAnderson et al., 2018a) and ranged between 3.7 and 4.2 μm. Thick ice\nfilms of 7 μm and 10 μm were also grown in experiments when the\ndeposition temperature was set at 140 K, 150 K and 160 K in order to\nstudy the C2H5CN ices as they started to sublime (≥140 K).\nWe also initiated a few experiments of co-condensed ices containing\nmixtures of HCN, C6H6, and C2H5CN, which initiated a new investiga-\ntion aimed at identifying the chemical composition of the Titan's CIRS-\nobserved Haystack emission feature. Specifically, we have begun a\ndetailed investigation to determine if co-condensed ices can account for\nthe chemical composition of the Haystack. The gas mixtures of HCN,\nC6H6, and C2H5CN previously purified were prepared through a va-\ncuum glass manifold previously pumped to 6 × 10−6 mbar. HCN was\nsynthesized in our laboratory as described in Anderson et al. (2018a),\nwhile benzene (99.99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Both were\npurified through several cycles of freeze-pump-thaw under vacuum\nusing cold baths of C2H5OH/LN2 (−116 °C) and acetone/LN2 (−94 °C).\nThe co-condensed ices were then obtained by depositing the gas mix-\ntures at 110 K. The full co-condensed ice study, however, as it pertains\nto the Haystack's chemical composition is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1. Study of the crystallization of propionitrile ice\n\nOne of the initial objectives of this work was to accurately identify\nthe temperature at which propionitrile ice transitions from its amor-\nphous to crystalline phase. For most of the previous Titan ice studies,\n\nFig. 3. Schematic illustration of the experimental setup used for the C2H5CN ice experiments in the SPECTRAL ice chamber (modified from Anderson et al., 2018a).\nVapor deposition of C2H5CN onto a cold diamond substrate (30 K – 160 K) forms a thin ice film that is monitored in situ by IR transmission spectroscopy from\n50 cm−1 to 11,700 cm−1 (200–0.85 μm) through a FTIR spectrometer. Double laser interferometry is used to determine the thickness of the ice films.\n\nD. Nna-Mvondo, et al.\nIcarus 333 (2019) 183–198\n\n187\n\nthe crystallization of an ice is commonly achieved by annealing the\nsample (Couturier-Tamburelli et al., 2018a, b; Couturier-Tamburelli\net al., 2015; Moore et al., 2010; Khanna, 2005a, 2005b; Dello Russo and\nKhanna, 1996; Khanna, 1995; Masterson and Khanna, 1990; Khanna\net al., 1990; Khanna et al., 1988; Ospina et al., 1988). This process\ninvolves depositing the vapor onto the cold substrate in the amorphous\nphase at very low temperatures (e.g. < 100 K), then warming the ice to\nits appropriate crystalline temperature, and annealing it for several\nhours at this temperature to allow the molecules to adopt a low-energy\nconfiguration. In previous Titan-related experimental studies on pro-\npionitrile ice, the crystalline phase was always achieved by annealing\nthe ice sample (see Table 1). Dello Russo (1994) and Dello Russo and\nKhanna (1996) deposited C2H5CN vapor between 50 and 100 K (the\nexact deposition temperatures are not specified), and annealed the ice\nat 140 K for 30 to 180 min (the exact times are not reported), then\ncooled the ice to 95 K and 35 K to record the transmittance spectra. On\nthe other hand, Khanna (2005a) deposited C2H5CN vapor at 60 K, an-\nnealed at 120 K for 4 to 5 h, then cooled/warmed the ice sample to 15 K,\n50 K, 80 K, 150 K, and 160 K to record the absorbance spectra. Moore\net al. (2010) deposited C2H5CN vapor at 50 K, annealed the ice sample\nat 140 K for 92 min in the far-IR and 90 min in the mid-IR, then cooled\nthe ice sample to 20 K, 35 K, 50 K, 75 K, 95 K, and 110 K to record the\nabsorbance spectra. As noted earlier, these three experimental studies\non the crystalline phase of propionitrile ice differ in the annealing\ntemperature and the annealing time duration to obtain crystalline\nC2H5CN (see Table 1). This raises uncertainties as to the crystallinity of\ntheir propionitrile ice samples. We therefore began our initial study on\npropionitrile ice by repeating these previous laboratory experiments to\nexamine the reproducibility of the crystalline phase",

Nicknamed the \"Hand of God,\" this object is called a pulsar wind nebula. It's powered by the leftover, dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion. The stellar corpse, called PSR B1509-58, is a pulsar. It rapidly spins around, seven times per second, firing out a particle wind into the material around it — material that was ejected in the star's explosion. These particles are interacting with magnetic fields around the material, causing it to glow with X-rays. For the first time, NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, has imaged a structure in high-energy X-rays (in blue). Lower-energy X-ray light previously detected by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is shown in green and red. The red cloud at the end of the finger region is a different structure, called RCW 89. Astronomers think the pulsar's wind is heating the cloud, causing it to glow with lower-energy X-ray light.

The European Space Agency leads the Herschel mission with important participation from NASA. This detailed-spectrum, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) - one of Herschel's three innovative instruments - demonstrates the gold mine of information that Herschel-HIFI will provide on how organic molecules form in space. The spectrum, one of the first to be obtained with HIFI since it returned to full health in January 2010 following technical difficulties, clearly demonstrates that the instrument is working well. Striking features in the HIFI spectrum include a rich, dense pattern of \"spikes\", each representing the emission of light from a specific molecule in the Orion Nebula. This nebula is known to be one of the most prolific chemical factories in space, although the full extent of its chemistry and the pathways for molecule formation are not well understood. By sifting through the pattern of spikes in this spectrum, astronomers have identified a few common molecules that appear everywhere in the spectrum. The identification of the many other emission lines is currently ongoing. By clearly identifying the lines associated with the more common molecules, astronomers can then begin to tease out the signature of particularly interesting molecules that are the direct precursors to life-enabling molecules. A characteristic feature of the Orion spectrum is the spectral richness: among the molecules that can be identified in this spectrum are water, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, dimethyl ether, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur oxide, sulfur dioxide and their isotope analogues. It is expected that new organic molecules will also be identified. \"This HIFI spectrum, and the many more to come, will provide a virtual treasure trove of information regarding the overall chemical inventory and on how organics form in a region of active star formation. It harbors the promise of a deep understanding of the chemistry of space once we have the full spectral surveys available,\" said Edwin Bergin of the University of Michigan, principal investigator of the HEXOS Key Program on Herschel. Unprecedented High Resolution HIFI was designed to provide extremely high-resolution spectra and to open new wavelength ranges for investigation, which are inaccessible to ground-based telescopes. \"It is astonishing to see how well HIFI works,\" said Frank Helmich, HIFI principal investigator of SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research. \"We obtained this spectrum in a few hours and it already beats any other spectrum, at any other wavelength, ever taken of Orion. Organics are everywhere in this spectrum, even at the lowest levels, which hints at the fidelity of HIFI. The development of HIFI took eight years but it was really worth waiting for.\" \"HIFI's unprecedented high resolution and stability allows us to construct very detailed models of the density and temperature structure of star-forming clouds,\" said Tom Phillips of the California Institute for Technology. \"This view allows us to pierce the veil of star formation and more directly study the chemistry associated with the birth of stars, planets, and in some sense, life.\" The spectrum was obtained only one month after HIFI resumed operations on-board Herschel. In August 2009, HIFI experienced an unexpected voltage spike in the electronic system, probably caused by a high-energy cosmic particle, resulting in the instrument shutting down. The mission team studied the problem and developed a solution that prevents harmful side-effects of this type of event. On 14 January 2010, HIFI was successfully switched back on using its spare electronics and restarted a sequence of testing and verification, ahead of science observations commencing on 28 February. It now rejoins the other two Herschel instruments, SPIRE and PACS, in their exploration of the far-infrared Universe. About Herschel and HIFI Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia, with important participation from NASA. HIFI, a high resolution spectrometer was designed and built by a nationally-funded consortium led by SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research. The consortium includes institutes from France, Germany, USA, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan. HIFI senses radiation in seven wavelength bands. NASA provided the mixers and local oscillator chains for the three highest bands, local oscillator components for four other bands, and power amplifiers. The enormous improvement in sensitivity and frequency coverage afforded by HIFI is a result of intense technology development at JPL supported by NASA over more than a decade. An innovative approach to providing the broad frequency coverage was developed using devices for frequency multiplication fabricated at JPL in conjunction with industry-developed amplifiers. The detectors and readout electronics used in Herschel's SPIRE instrument were also developed and fabricated at JPL. Identification of the many spectral features visible in the Orion spectrum with transitions of particular molecular species requires sophisticated molecular spectroscopy databases, which collect the results from many years of laboratory spectroscopy work. The assignments for this HIFI spectrum were made using the Cologne Database of Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS) and an equivalent database maintained at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. NASA's Herschel Project Office is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). JPL contributed mission-enabling technology for two of Herschel's three science instruments, including HIFI.

The script underwent significant enhancements and\n\t  'under-the-hood' re-working that was introduced alongside the CIAO 4.15 release. For the purposes of the thread, Version 2.3 of the relxill collection of relativistic and\n\t    non-relativistic reflection models will be used for the\n\t    example of \n\t    building the models for the ciao-install distribution of CIAO with system compilers. Version 1.0.1 of the RELTRANS reverberation mapping models will be used for the\n\t    example of building with a Conda distribution of CIAO. Version 2.47 of the WARMABS XSpec packageâa collection of warm\n\t    absorption and photoionized emission models derived from the XSTAR program that calculates physical conditions and\n\t    spectra of photoionized gasses. will be used for the examples herein. The convert_xspec_user_model script\n\t  is similar to the XSpec initpackage command,\n\t  so follow the model instructions to make any changes that\n\t  would be needed before running initpackage , and then run convert_xspec_user_model instead. MacOS and the XCode SDK Often, compilers require access to system files to correctly build\n\t    programs and a standardized set for MacOS is available through\n\t    XCode's Software Development Kit (SDK). The CIAO binary installation already requires XCode presently, so you may\n\t    set: (t)csh unix% setenv SDKROOT `xcrun --show-sdk-path` bash/zsh unix% export SDKROOT=`xcrun --show-sdk-path` For Conda, it may be also necessary to set CONDA_BUILD_SYSROOT , (t)csh unix% setenv CONDA_BUILD_SYSROOT `xcrun --show-sdk-path` bash/zsh unix% export CONDA_BUILD_SYSROOT=`xcrun --show-sdk-path` but if XCode is not available on your system for Conda,\n\t    the SDK may be externally\n\t    acquired .

The Clang/LLVM\n\t    compilers that come packaged with XCode should be used to\n\t    build C/C++ software for CIAO/Sherpa distributed through\n\t    the binaries (e.g. via ciao-install ) on MacOS and\n\t    that on a typical system, gcc and g++ are linked to use clang and clang++ respectively by default. GNU C and\n\t    C++ may sometimes be used successfully in lieu\n\t    of Clang.  Pre-built distributions of GNU Fortran\n\t    compilers are also available for MacOS. It is worth mentioning that as of relxill 2.3, the native Clang\n\t    compiler has trouble building the model.  There has been\n\t    limited success building with the x86-64 GNU\n\t    ( gcc / g++ ) compilers into the CIAO binary\n\t    distribution and buildable into\n\t    the Conda CIAO distribution using the Conda compilers for MacOS. An important step to using this collection of models is to\n\t  make sure they have access to the tabulated data the models are\n\t  dependent upon.  The relxill documentation notes\n\t  that the RELXILL_TABLE_PATH environment variable\n\t  should be used to define this location. Assuming the table\n\t  files are downloaded and unpacked to /path/to/directory/with/relxill/table/files , then\n\t  within a Sherpa or Python environment with the models\n\t  imported, the os.environ Python object should be used to\n\t  internally set this environment variable: sherpa> import relxill_v2.ui\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelline\nAdding convolution    XSPEC local model: xsumrelconv\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelline_lp\nAdding convolution    XSPEC local model: xsumrelconv_lp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxill\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxilllp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumxillver\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumxillvercp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxillcp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxilllpcp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumxillverns\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxillns\n\nsherpa> os.environ [\"RELXILL_TABLE_PATH\"] = \"/path/to/directory/with/relxill/table/files\" to set the location for the models to look in.  If you\n\t  would like to avoid declaring the os.environ[\"RELXILL_TABLE_PATH\"] whenever the relxill model package is initially imported, the\n\t  path can be hardcoded into the common.h file before\n\t  compiling the package, changing the line (line 117 as of v2.3): #define RELXILL_TABLE_PATH \"./\" to #define RELXILL_TABLE_PATH \"/path/to/directory/with/relxill/table/files\" Compiling a user model for the Conda CIAO distribution Compiling software compatible with a Conda environment and\n\t  other Conda packages should not be anymore involved than\n\t  building with the system's default compilers, but should be\n\t  more stable with the environment and requires a different tack. In this example, the RELTRANS models package will be\n\t  used.  The file reltrans_v1.0.1.tar.gz is assumed to have\n\t  been downloaded and unpacked; for example: unix% cd /data/models/reltrans_v1\nunix% tar -xzf reltrans_v1.0.1.tar.gz\nunix% cd reltrans_v1.0.1/\n\nunix% ls -F \namodules.f90       lmodel_relxill.dat  rellp.c      reltable.h     revmakefile_laptop\nclean.xcm*         load.xcm            rellp.h      relutility.c   srevtrans.f90\ncommon.h           README.txt          relmodels.c  relutility.h   subroutines/\ncompile_xspec.sh*  relbase.c           relmodels.h  revmakefile    xilltable.c\ndonthcomp.c        relbase.h           reltable.c   revmakefile_g  xilltable.h Out of the box no additional file modifications are needed\n\t  for the the RELTRANS v1 models.  Please note that \n\t  the minor modifications to the\n\t  unpacked relxill source code, illustrated\n\t  earlier in this thread, are applicable for a Conda build too. Setting up the Conda environment for model compilation Packages on a Conda distribution channel are built\n\t      using a standardized set of compilers and build dependenices, also available on that\n\t      given channel.

What to do if the build fails There are a number of reasons why the build might fail;\n\t  please contact the CXC Helpdesk if you are unable to solve \n\t  the problem.\n\t  The --clobber flag may be needed if convert_xspec_user_model is called multiple times,\n\t  and sometimes directly deleting the src and build sub-directories generated by the script in\n\t  the directory with the model source code may clear things up. In CIAO 4.8, Only additive and multiplicative models\n\t      are supported.  Convolution model support was added\n\t      in CIAO contributed scripts package 4.9.2 and in CIAO\n\t      4.13, XSpec convolution models are directly supported by\n\t      Sherpa. Support for models that require\n\t      the -udmget or -udmget64 flag when calling XSpec's initpackage command was added in the CIAO\n\t      contributed scripts package 4.15.2 using the --udmget or --udmget64 , respectively. There can be problems if your version of gcc and gfortran is much different than the version\n\t      used to build CIAO 4.17 (GCC 13.2.0 on Redhat\n\t      Enterprise Linux 8.8 and Clang 14.0.6/gfortran 13.2.0 on\n\t      MacOS 11.5). This can lead to link errors such as: undefined symbol: _gfortran_copy_string The script does not guarantee to compile files in the\n\t      same order as XSpec does, so if an ordering is\n\t      required, then the build may fail. If there are linker or build issues, then the flags --no-xspec and --cfitsio may be\n\t      useful: --no-xspec means that no XSpec\n\t      libraries are linked to and --cfitsio can\n\t      be added if the model only uses the CFITSIO routines. There may also be a version conflict between the\n\t      XSpec version needed by the model and that\n\t      provided by Sherpa , which uses version 12.14.0k\n\t      in CIAO 4.17. If there is a problem when building the interface the resulting error \n\t      message is unlikely to be useful. In this case try running unix% pip install . --verbose as it should provide more information. Possible problems are models that refer to XSpec code\n\t      from older (or newer) versions of XSpec than used by\n\t      CIAO, as well as access to certain parts of the XSpec\n\t      build system. Some of these can be worked\n\t      aroundâsuch as removing the problematic models or\n\t      tweaking how the extension module is built in setup.py . Testing the model in Sherpa Once the model has been compiled ,\n\t  it can be used from Sherpa . For the relxill model,\n\t  we can try it without any data or response information using\n\t  the following. First, load in the module and set the RELXILL_TABLE_PATH environment variable /path/to/directory/with/relxill/table/files (substitute with the location of your model's tabulated data\n\t  dependency on your system): sherpa> import relxill_v2.ui\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelline\nAdding convolution    XSPEC local model: xsumrelconv\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelline_lp\nAdding convolution    XSPEC local model: xsumrelconv_lp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxill\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxilllp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumxillver\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumxillvercp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxillcp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxilllpcp\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumxillverns\nAdding additive       XSPEC local model: xsumrelxillns\n  \nsherpa> os.environ[\" RELXILL_TABLE_PATH \"] = \" /path/to/directory/with/relxill/table/files \" Now we create a simple data space over which the model\n\t can be evaluated and the model expression\n\t (note that the user model used in the same manner as the\n\t built-in models). The default\n\t ' xsum ' prefix of the model names is shorthand for\n\t \"XSpec user-model\"; the \"--prefix\" flag can be used to\n\t alter the prefix, taking care to avoid using the lower case\n\t ' xs ' since it is already used for the standard set\n\t of XSpec models in Sherpa and risks the possibility of\n\t overwriting the models if it has the same name.  The xsumrelconv convolution model will be used in this\n\t example: sherpa> dataspace1d (0.1, 10, step=0.01, id=1, dstype=Data1DInt)\n\nsherpa> set_source(xsumrelconv.rel1(const1d.c0))\n\nsherpa> show_source()\nModel: 1\nxsumrelconv.rel1(const1d.c0)\n   Param        Type          Value          Min          Max      Units\n   -----        ----          -----          ---          ---      -----\n   rel1.Index1  frozen            3          -10           10           \n   rel1.Index2  frozen            3          -10           10           \n   rel1.Rbr     frozen           15            1         1000           \n   rel1.a       thawed        0.998       -0.998        0.998           \n   rel1.Incl    frozen           30            3           87        deg\n   rel1.Rin     frozen           -1         -100           -1           \n   rel1.Rout    frozen          400            1         1000           \n   rel1.limb    frozen            0            0            2           \n   c0.c0        thawed            1 -3.40282e+38  3.40282e+38 Parameter names The parameter names specified in the XSpec \" model.dat \" file\n\t   are not always valid for Python, so a transformation is made,\n\t   converting unusable charactersâsuch as + and / âinto the\n\t   underscore character ( _ ). Two versions of the model are now plotted on the same\n\t graph; first for the default parameter values and\n\t then after changing the inclination angle, Incl ,\n\t parameter, which creates Figure 1 : sherpa> plot_source()\n *** loading RELXILL model (version 2.3) ***\n\nsherpa> rel1.Incl = 80\nsherpa> plot_source(overplot=True)\nsherpa> plt.loglog() Figure 1: Comparison of two model plots Figure 1: Comparison of two model plots The blue line shows the model using the\n\t    default parameters, whereas the orange line\n\t    shows the model after changing the Incl parameter to 80 degrees. Since there is no response information hereâas\n\t    no RMF has been\n\t    loadedâthen the axes have no units. External files for configuration Many models require, or allow, external configuration.\n\t  The set_xsxset command is the equivalent\n\t  of XSpec's xset command.\n\n\t  As an example: sherpa> set_xsxset('CARBATM', '/data/models/data/carbatm') sets the XSpec CARBATM variable. The equivalent location to XSpec's spectral/ directory\n\t  is ${ASCDS_INSTALL}/ots/spectral/ . Other models will access data dependencies through a\n\t  specified shell environment variable, which may be set \n\t  in Sherpa using the os.environ Python object, as demonstrated\n\t  earlier in this thread, sherpa> os.environ[\"RELXILL_TABLE_PATH\"] = \"/path/to/directory/with/relxill/table/files\" Use of set_xsxset versus os.environ will\n\t  be completely model dependent, which should be informed based on the\n\t  specific model's user-documentation. Example: a model that successfully compiles to completion but fails at execution The WARMABS Fortran model readily compiles on Conda\n\t  without setting any specific compiler or linker flags, but\n\t  was problematic when building it against the CIAO 4.15 Linux binary\n\t  distribution on a RHEL 8 system and its native compilers\n\t  (GCC 8.5.0).  A link to the most recent version of the model\n\t  may be found on the XSTAR page ( WARMABS v2.50 from December 2024). In this demonstration, (t)csh syntax is used to set environment\n\t  variablesâwhich can be easily substituted with the\n\t  equivalent export call in bash/zshâand the WARMABS model package is assumed to have been\n\t  downloaded and unpacked, unix% mkdir warmabs_v247\nunix% tar -xzf warmabs247.tar.gz -C warmabs_v247\n\nunix% ls -F warmabs_v247\natdbwarmabs.fits   PARAMX            xo01_detah4.fits  xo01_detal3.fits\ncoheatwarmabs.dat  README            xo01_detahl.fits  xo01_detal4.fits\nfphotems.f90       xo01_detah2.fits  xo01_detail.fits\nlmodel.dat         xo01_detah3.fits  xo01_detal2.fits For organizational purposes, the data tables used by the\n\t  models are separated from the source code and moved to a\n\t  separate directory: unix% ls -F /path/to/warmabs_v2.4x/data/files\natdbwarmabs.fits   xo01_detah3.fits  xo01_detail.fits  xo01_detal4.fits\ncoheatwarmabs.dat  xo01_detah4.fits  xo01_detal2.fits\nxo01_detah2.fits   xo01_detahl.fits  xo01_detal3.fits The model package will be built with the module name\n\t  ' warmabs_v247 ' herein.

In the nearby galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud, a massive star has exploded as a supernova, and begun to dissipate its interior into a spectacular display of colorful filaments. The supernova remnant (SNR), known as \"E0102\" for short, is the greenish-blue shell of debris just below the center of the Hubble image. Its name is derived from its cataloged placement (or coordinates) in the celestial sphere. More formally known as 1E0102.2-7219, it is located almost 50 light-years away from the edge of the massive star-forming region, N 76, also known as Henize 1956 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. This delicate structure, glowing a multitude of lavenders and peach hues, resides in the upper right of the image. Determined to be only about 2,000 years old, E0102 is relatively young on astronomical scales and is just beginning its interactions with the nearby interstellar medium. Young supernova remnants like E0102 allow astronomers to examine material from the cores of massive stars directly. This in turn gives insight on how stars form, their composition, and the chemical enrichment of the surrounding area. As well, young remnants are a great learning tool to better understand the physics of supernova explosions. E0102 was observed in 2003 with the Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys. Four filters that isolate light from blue, visible, and infrared wavelengths and hydrogen emission were combined with oxygen emission images of the SNR taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in 1995. The Small Magellanic Cloud is a nearby dwarf galaxy to our own Milky Way. It is visible in the Southern Hemisphere, in the direction of the constellation Tucana, and lies roughly 210,000 light-years distant. About the Object R.A. Position R.A. Position Right ascension – analogous to longitude – is one component of an object's position. 01h 4m 1.49s Dec. Position Dec. Position Declination – analogous to latitude – is one component of an object's position. -72° 1' 55.7\" Constellation Constellation One of 88 recognized regions of the celestial sphere in which the object appears. Tucana Distance Distance The physical distance from Earth to the astronomical object. Distances within our solar system are usually measured in Astronomical Units (AU). Distances between stars are usually measured in light-years. Interstellar distances can also be measured in parsecs. The distance to the SMC is roughly 210,000 light-years (64 kiloparsecs). Dimensions Dimensions The physical size of the object or the apparent angle it subtends on the sky. Roughly 3.0 arcminutes (180 light-years or 56 parsecs) wide About the Data Data Description Data Description Proposal: A description of the observations, their scientific justification, and the links to the data available in the science archive.

With its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution at key wavelengths, Herschel revealed this crucial molecule in star-forming molecular clouds, detected it for the first time in the seeds of future stars and planets, and identified the delivery of water from interplanetary debris to planets in our Solar System. Water is essential to life as we know it on Earth. It covers over 70% of our planet’s surface and is present in trace amounts in the atmosphere. While it may seem abundant, especially if we're looking at the blue-hued stretch of a lake, sea or ocean, water is only a minor component of the total mass of Earth. In fact, it is not at all clear whether the water that is currently present on our blue planet was there around the time of its formation, 4.6 billion years ago, or it is was delivered by later impacts of smaller celestial objects. According to one of the leading theories to explain how the Solar System came into being, Earth and the inner planets were extremely hot and dry for the first several hundred million years after their formation. In this scenario, water was delivered to these planets only later by violent impacts of small bodies such as meteorites, asteroids, and/or comets – the remaining debris of the protoplanetary disc out of which the planets and their moons took shape. There are various avenues to investigate the origin of this crucial molecule on our planet, either following the clues in our cosmic neighbourhood – the Solar System – or looking into the stellar nurseries where analogues of our Sun and planets are being born. ESA's Herschel Space Observatory, an extraordinary mission that was launched in 2009 and that observed the sky at far-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths for almost four years, took a comprehensive approach, tracing water from stars and planets in the forming across our Milky Way galaxy to planets and minor Solar System bodies in our own neck of the woods. Water in the Universe Water was first detected in star-forming molecular clouds in the late 1960s. At the time, it was the sixth interstellar molecule to be identified, compared to the nearly 200 that are known to date. Ever since its discovery, astronomers suspected that water would be present in a variety of cosmic environments. After all, it is made up of the two most abundant reactive elements that exist – hydrogen, which dates back to the Big Bang, and oxygen, produced in the furnaces of stars throughout the history of the Universe. In fact, water has been observed in celestial objects as diverse as planets, moons, stars, star-forming clouds, and even beyond our Milky Way, in the stellar cradles of other galaxies. However, due to the water vapour present in the Earth's atmosphere, studying this molecule with astronomical observations is anything but trivial. Over the decades, astronomers have used a wide range of facilities to study water in the cosmos, from ground-based observatories in the dry climate of mountain-tops and airborne telescopes to experiments on stratospheric balloons and space observatories and even on the Space Shuttle. Far from the moist environment of our planet, a space telescope is of course the ideal tool to investigate cosmic water. The first satellite dedicated to this topic, ESA's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), was launched in 1995 and operated until 1998, shortly followed by NASA's Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) and Spitzer Space Telescope, and by the Swedish-led, international Odin satellite. Stepping into this long-established tradition, Herschel pushed the quest of cosmic water to new heights with a phenomenal piece of hardware, the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) – one of the three instruments on board. To reveal the presence of a molecule in a cosmic source, astronomers look for a set of very distinctive fingerprints, or lines, in the source's spectrum, which are caused by rotation or vibration transitions in the structure of the molecule. These lines are observed within a stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum, covering infrared to microwave wavelengths, depending on the type of molecule and its temperature. In the case of water, some of the most interesting lines – the ones that correspond to the lowest energetic configuration of water vapour, in other words its ground or 'cold' state – are found in the far-infrared and sub-millimetre ranges, which are inaccessible from the ground. Specially designed for the hunt for water and other molecules, Herschel's HIFI instrument had an unprecedented spectral resolution that could target about 40 different water lines, each coming from a different transition of the water molecule and thus sensitive to a different temperature. In particular, unlike its predecessors, Herschel was sensitive to two different transitions of the ground state of water that correspond to the two 'spin' forms of the molecule, called ortho and para, in which the spins of the hydrogen nuclei have different orientations. This key feature allowed astronomers to determine the temperatures under which the water formed by comparing the relative amounts of ortho and para water. Two of the observatory's Key Programmes – Water in Star-forming regions with Herschel and Water and Related Chemistry in the Solar System – dedicated several hundred hours to the quest for cosmic water. Exploiting the outstanding data collected by HIFI, along with observations performed with Herschel's two other instruments, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), astronomers have been able to greatly expand our understanding of the role of water in the Universe. Water in the progenitors of stars and planets While water vapour in star-forming regions had been known for quite a while, Herschel discovered it, for the first time, in a pre-stellar core – a cold lump of dense material that will later turn into a star. The pre-stellar core, called Lynds 1544, is located in the Taurus molecular cloud, a vast region of gas and dust that is incubating the seeds of future stars and planets. With the Herschel data, astronomers could estimate also the amount of water vapour in Lynds 1544 – the equivalent of over 2000 times the water content of Earth’s oceans. The water vapour derives from icy dust grains, hinting at a reservoir of over a thousand times more water in the form of ice. If any planets are to emerge around the star taking shape from this core, it is likely that some of the water detected by Herschel will find its way to the planets as well. En route to becoming stars, pre-stellar cores keep accreting matter from their parent cloud until they separate from it, turning into a protostar, an independent object that is collapsing under its own gravity. Normally, a rotating disc of gas and dust – a protoplanetary disc – takes shape around protostars, providing the material for the formation of future planets. Finally, when nuclear reactions ignite in the core of the protostar, counteracting the collapse, a fully-fledged star is born. Herschel has spotted water in objects spanning all stages of star formation, including in a large number of low-mass protostars found in many nearby star-forming regions. For the first time, astronomers using Herschel have detected cold water vapour in a protoplanetary disc. While previous studies had revealed either hot water vapour in the inner part of similar discs, or water ice in their outskirts, Herschel's observations targeting the disc around the nearby young star TW Hydrae were the first to identify cold water vapour, with temperatures lower than 100 K, in such an object. The cold vapour appears to be located in a thin layer at intermediate depths in the disc, where the evaporation of gas and the freeze-out of ice find a balance. The data indicate a small amount of cold vapour, equivalent to about 0.5 per cent of the water in Earth's oceans, but point to a much larger reservoir of water ice – several thousand Earth oceans – in the disc. This was the first evidence that large amounts of water ice can be stored in the precursor of a planetary system like our own, thus contributing more evidence to tackling the puzzle of the origin of water on Earth and other planets. Water in the Solar System Besides proving that water is an important constituent of stars and planets since their early formation, Herschel also followed its trail all the way to our local neighbourhood, the Solar System. To compare water found in different celestial bodies, astronomers analyse the relative abundance of molecules with a slightly different composition. Most notably, they look at the D/H ratio, comparing 'ordinary' water, composed of two hydrogen (H) and one oxygen (O) atoms, and semi-heavy water, where one of the hydrogen atoms appears as deuterium (D), an isotopical form with an extra neutron. Before Herschel, this measurement had been performed on a handful of comets, all of them thought to originate in the Oort cloud at the outskirts of our Solar System, and all of them revealing higher proportions of deuterium to 'normal' hydrogen than that found in Earth's oceans. These results seemed to suggest that comets – icy leftovers of our ancient protoplanetary disc – could not have been the source of our planet's water, while a specific class of meteorites, called Cl carbonaceous chondrites, possessed the 'right' D/H ratio and thus seemed to be the main culprit. In 2011, Herschel's observations of water in Comet 103P/Hartley 2 reopened this fascinating debate. This measurement was the first of its kind performed for a Jupiter-Family comet – a class of comets with orbits governed by Jupiter's gravity and with much shorter period with respect to their Oort-cloud counterparts – and revealed, for the first time, water with a deuterium to hydrogen proportion similar to that found on our planet. Herschel contributed two more observations to the debate, finding a Jupiter-Family comet (45P/Honda-Mrkos- Pajdušáková) with Earth-like water, and an Oort-cloud comet (2009P1) with a different blend from that of our planet's water. The plot thickened when ESA's Rosetta mission reached Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in 2014 and sampled the water content in its atmosphere. Rosetta's comet is also a Jupiter-Family one but, unlike the two observed by Herschel, it does not contain Earth-like water; on the contrary, it turned out to have the highest D/H ratio ever measured for a comet. While Rosetta revealed that not all Jupiter-Family comets contain water that is similar to that of our planet's oceans, Herschel's earlier detections had importantly pointed out that comets with the right composition do exist and some might indeed have contributed to Earth's water budget. In fact, current models indicate that a broad and diverse range of minor bodies contributed to the critical role of bringing water to our planet. Elsewhere in the Solar System, Herschel has gone as far as confirming that at least one comet has contributed to enriching a different planet – Jupiter – with water. By investigating the distribution of water vapour in the stratosphere of the giant planet, astronomers found evidence that almost all of it was delivered by the famous impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994. Following water throughout the Solar System, Herschel has found this molecule in many more places, from the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest body in the asteroid belt, to a giant torus of water vapour surrounding Saturn, which appears to be supplied by the planet's small moon Enceladus. As revealed by the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini mission, Enceladus exhibits plumes of water drawing from the underground ocean lurking under its icy crust. Farther away from the Sun, Herschel revealed highly reflecting surfaces on several Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), indicating that water ice might be present even on these ancient, remote objects. While TNOs date back to the early formation of our Solar System, astronomers suspect that their bright icy coating may be more recent – a speculative but not unfeasible hypothesis given the availability of water on outer planets like Uranus and Neptune, and on their major moons. Such a recent coating might also suggest that the surface of these long-thought ‘dead’ objects can in fact be alive, as highlighted also by the in-situ observations performed in 2015 by NASA’s New Horizon probe of another TNO, the dwarf planet Pluto. Outlook Out to much grander scales, beyond our Solar System and the Galactic confines of the Milky Way, Herschel has detected water in many other galaxies. As already highlighted by some of its predecessors, the findings corroborate the crucial role of this all-important molecule in the processes that lead to the birth of stars throughout the cosmos. Given its chemical composition, water unsurprisingly is ubiquitous in the Universe, and, after Herschel, there is no longer any doubt that cosmic water trails go a long way, from planets to stars, and even to the vastness of interstellar space. However, Herschel has only begun scratching the surface of the proverbial iceberg, having spotted water in individual cosmic sources that are, in many cases, one of a kind. These exciting discoveries call for future surveys to follow up on Herschel's observations, collecting larger samples of each type of sources to scrutinise water and other molecules and delve into the physical mechanisms underlying their formation and delivery across the cosmos.

        "full_text": "HAWC: Are photons of extreme energies coming from the Galaxy's \nlargest accelerator?\n\nFor years, in the vastness of our galaxy, astrophysicists have been tracking down PeVatrons \n- natural accelerators of particles with monstrous energies. Thanks to the HAWC \nObservatory for Cosmic Radiation, another probable trace of their existence has just been \nfound: photons with some of the highest energies. However, what is particularly important is \nthat this time the high-energy photons have not only been recorded, but also their probable \nplace of origin has been determined.\n\nWe know they exist, we just don't know where exactly they are or what they look like. \nPeVatrons – because this is what we are talking about here - are the largest natural particle \naccelerators in our galaxy, capable of accelerating protons and electrons to energies even \nbillions of times greater than the energy of photons of visible light. The problem with \ndetecting PeVatrons stems from the fact that the particles they accelerate carry an electric \ncharge and are therefore deflected by magnetic fields in the galaxy. The discovery which has \njust been made thanks to data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) \nGamma-Ray Observatory brings us significantly closer to finding the first cosmic PeVatron \nand understanding its nature.\n\nThe HAWC Observatory is located on the slope of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, at an \naltitude of 4,100m. It consists of 300 water tanks, each surrounded by sensitive \nphotomultipliers. When a particle of secondary cosmic radiation traveling at a speed faster \nthan the speed of light in water enters a tank, there is an electromagnetic \"boom\" - a weak \nflash of radiation (Cherenkov), detected and amplified by the photomultipliers. A careful \nanalysis of flashes observed at the same time in individual tanks makes it possible to extract \ninformation about the type, energy and direction of the particle of the primary cosmic \nradiation which initiated the recorded cascade of secondary particles\n\n\"Based on data collected by the HAWC, we were able to determine the source of photons \nwith energies of about 200 tera-electron volts. For photons, this is an extreme value, one \nhundred trillion times greater than the energy typical of photons perceived by our eyes,\" says \nDr. hab. Sabrina Casanova, from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of \nSciences (IFJ PAN) in Cracow. Together with Dr. Francisco Sales Greus (IFJ PAN) and PhD \nstudent Dezhi Huang from the Michigan Technological University in Houghton (USA), she is \none of the main authors of the analysis published in the excellent astronomical journal The \nAstrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nCompared to protons and electrons, photons have a pleasant feature: they ignore magnetic \nfields and run to their target along the shortest path that space-time allows. So, once the \ndirection from which the photons are coming is identified within a galaxy, it is usually \npossible to determine their source. This is not an easy task, but in this case it was \nsuccessful. The source of the 200 TeV photons turned out to be a region of the recently \ndiscovered pulsar eHWC J1825-134, visible in the southern hemisphere in the background \nof the Vela constellation, and lying at a distance of about 13 thousand light years from Earth.\n\nObservations of such high-energy photons are rare, and it is even rarer to identify the \nsource. The record currently belongs to photons with energies of 450 TeV, detected with the \nSino-Japanese AS-gamma detector in Tibet. In that case, the photons came from the vicinity \nof a pulsar in the famous Crab nebula in the background of the Taurus constellation.\n\n\"We now know of two mechanisms that can explain the existence of photons with energies \nof 200 TeV and above,\" explains Dr Salesa Greus, before elaborating: \"According to the first, \nthe source of such energetic photons could be electrons with slightly higher energies, \nemitted by supernova remnants or pulsars and then interacting with the microwave \nbackground radiation filling the Universe. This case seems to fit the Crab nebula. The \nsecond variant of the course of events assumes that photons are born due to the interaction \nof protons emitted by a pulsar with matter in interstellar space. What is particularly \ninteresting in this scenario is that the energies of the protons must be at least an order of \nmagnitude greater than the energies of the observed photons!\"\n\nThe region of the eHWC J1825-134 pulsar is a complex astronomical structure with several \nsources of high-energy gamma rays within it. HAWC researchers have determined that the \norigin of the 200 TeV photons was not the pulsar itself, but a previously unknown source: a \nnearby cloud of interstellar material. It surrounds a young cluster of stars, about one million \nyears old, designated as [BDS2003] 8. The observed photons could thus have been emitted \nby protons from the eHWC J1825-134 pulsar which, within the [BDS2003] 8 star cluster, had \nenough time to accelerate in the local magnetic field to energies of a few petaelectron volts \nand produce energetic photons in the interaction with the cloud. If this variant of the course \nof events is confirmed in subsequent observations, we would be dealing with the first \nPeVatron identified in our galaxy.\n\n\"For the time being, we have too little data to unambiguously decide on the nature of the \ncosmic accelerator responsible for the generation of 200 TeV photons in the region of eHWC \nJ1825-134. If, however, there is a galactic PeVatron hiding somewhere, we have managed \nto find a really excellent candidate\", notes Dr Casanova.\n\nThe research of scientists from the IFJ PAN was funded by a grant from the National \nScience Centre.",

With the recent discoveries of over 40 ultra-high-\n6\n\nenergy gamma-ray sources (detected above 100 TeV) and neutrino emission in the Galactic\n7\n\nPlane, we have entered a new era of multi-messenger astrophysics facing the exciting reality of\n8\n\nGalactic PeVatrons. In the next decade, as more Galactic PeVatrons and TeV gamma-ray sources\n9\n\nare expected to be discovered, the identification of their acceleration and emission mechanisms\n10\n\nwill be the most pressing issue in both particle and high-energy astrophysics. In this paper, along\n11\n\nwith its companion papers (Reynolds et al. 2023, Mori et al. 2023), we will present that HEX-P\n12\n\nis uniquely suited to address important problems in various cosmic-ray accelerators, including\n13\n\nGalactic PeVatrons, through investigating synchrotron X-ray emission of TeV–PeV electrons\n14\n\nproduced by both leptonic and hadronic processes. For Galactic PeVatron candidates and other\n15\n\nTeV gamma-ray sources, HEX-P can fill in a large gap in the spectral-energy distributions (SEDs)\n16\n\nof many objects observed in radio, soft X-rays, and gamma rays, constraining the maximum\n17\n\nenergies to which electrons can be accelerated, with implications for the nature of the Galactic\n18\n\nPeVatrons and their contributions to the spectrum of Galactic cosmic rays beyond the knee at ∼3\n19\n\nPeV. In particular, X-ray observation with HEX-P and TeV observation with CTA will provide the\n20\n\nmost powerful multi-messenger diagnostics to identify Galactic PeVatrons and explore a variety\n21\n\nof astrophysical shock mechanisms. We present simulations of each class of Galactic TeV–PeV\n22\n\nsources, demonstrating the power of both the imaging and spectral capabilities of HEX-P to\n23\n\nadvance our knowledge of Galactic cosmic-ray accelerators. In addition, we discuss HEX-P’s\n24\n\nunique and complementary roles to upcoming gamma-ray and neutrino observatories in the\n25\n\n2030s.\n26\n\nKeywords: particle accelerators, Galactic PeVatrons, star clusters, superbubbles, microquasars, gamma-ray binaries, X-ray telescopes,\n27\n\nmultimessenger astronomy\n28\n\n1\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the last few decades, it has become clear that energetic particles (cosmic rays, CRs) make up a\n29\n\nsignificant component of the Universe. In galaxies, cosmic rays can power galactic winds, support galactic\n30\n\ncoronae, and control star formation through ionization of molecular clouds. They can influence the structure\n31\n\nof large-scale galactic magnetic fields and their propagation can drive turbulence in the interstellar medium.\n32\n\n(See, e.g., Heintz and Zweibel (2022) and references therein.) The most energetic cosmic rays, with\n33\n\nenergies from 1015 eV (1 PeV) up to and above 1019 eV, appear to fill the Universe, traveling enormous\n34\n\ndistances to arrive at Earth – the only form of extragalactic matter we will be able to directly examine.\n35\n\nX-ray astronomy has brought powerful insights into the mechanisms by which Nature accelerates particles\n36\n\nto energies many orders of magnitude above thermal energies. While radio astronomy even from its infancy\n37\n\ngave evidence of electrons with GeV energies (through the diffuse Galactic synchrotron background\n38\n\ndiscovered by chance by Karl Jansky in 1932, though its origin wasn’t clear for decades), it was known\n39\n\nlong before the advent of space astronomy that far higher energies were exhibited by some particles,\n40\n\nto the extent that high-energy physics experiments were conducted on mountaintops to tap the flux of\n41\n\nincoming cosmic rays, long before the advent of terrestrial particle accelerators. But clues to the origin\n42\n\nFrontiers\n2\n\nMori et al.\n\nof the highest-energy particles required the ability to image sources in photons above the optical window.\n43\n\nQuasar continua supplied evidence for optical synchrotron radiation, but the details of the process could\n44\n\nnot be deduced from unresolved observations. X-ray astronomy first allowed the inference of the presence\n45\n\nof TeV particles at their sources, with the detection of the featureless X-ray spectrum of SN 1006 and its\n46\n\ninterpretation as synchrotron emission from electrons with such energies.\n47\n\nThe advent of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) as a mechanism for the production of suprathermal\n48\n\nparticles in shocks constituted a major advance in understanding, along with the observational data supplied\n49\n\nby several generations of X-ray satellites, most importantly Chandra and XMM. It has been well-established\n50\n\nthat TeV electrons are present in most young shell supernova remnants (SNRs), with about ten objects\n51\n\ndominated by non-thermal synchrotron emission, and clear non-thermal spectral components in others\n52\n\nalongside thermal emission. The initial hope that young SNRs could furnish the origin of all cosmic rays\n53\n\nwas dashed by the realization based on very general considerations that standard SNR evolution could\n54\n\nproduce energies only up to several PeV, where a steepening of the integrated cosmic ray spectrum suggests\n55\n\na decreasing efficiency of cosmic-ray production by Galactic sources. More detailed study strongly suggests\n56\n\nthat reaching even that energy may be difficult (e.g., Lagage and Cesarsky, 1983). See Blasi (2013) for a\n57\n\nreview.\n58\n\nMore recently, gamma-ray astronomy has revealed many Galactic sources with energies in the GeV\n59\n\nrange (observed by Fermi-LAT) to above 1 PeV (observed by ground-based imaging atmospheric Cerenkov\n60\n\ntelescopes (IACTs), such as VERITAS, MAGIC, and H.E.S.S., or extensive air-shower arrays (EASAs),\n61\n\nsuch as HAWC and LHAASO). Recently, a new exciting discovery has been made by IceCube as they have\n62\n\nidentified neutrino emission in the Galactic Plane (IceCube Collaboration et al., 2023). Angular resolutions\n63\n\nof these instruments often do not allow unambiguous identification with sources at lower photon energies,\n64\n\nlet alone provide morphological clues to the origins of the fast particles in those sources. The imaging\n65\n\ncapabilities of X-ray telescopes, current and planned, can address the gaps in our understanding resulting\n66\n\nfrom the mismatch between high-resolution radio observations of GeV electrons, and the observations of\n67\n\nparticles (electrons or hadrons) of up to and above 1 PeV.\n68\n\nVarious classes of objects are now known to produce energetic particles: SNRs, pulsar-wind nebulae\n69\n\n(PWNe) at the termination shock of the pulsar’s relativistic wind forming the inner boundary of the PWN,\n70\n\nsuperbubbles driven by multiple supernovae, and termination shocks of jets from ”microquasars” such as\n71\n\nSS433. Arguments have been made for each of these as the primary source of the most energetic Galactic\n72\n\ncosmic rays, but in no case do we have conclusive determinations.\n73\n\nA full understanding of the physics of particle acceleration in shocks, and elsewhere, and in particular, of\n74\n\nthe nature of the most energetic sources (“PeVatrons”), will require a new generation of instruments. In the\n75\n\ncontext of DSA, we still do not understand the details of how electrons become initially accelerated; how\n76\n\nthe accelerated-particle population, both electrons and ions, develops and affects the local environment\n77\n\n(magnetic field, thermal fluid); what determines the fractions of shock energy going into particles and\n78\n\nmagnetic field; and what determines the maximum energy to which particles are accelerated, with possibly\n79\n\ndifferent limitations applying to electrons and hadrons. For the wind termination shocks of PWNe, the\n80\n\nadditional complications of special-relativistic effects are present.\n81\n\nIn particular, an attack on the problem of the nature of “PeVatrons” can be divided into two fronts: a better\n82\n\nunderstanding of the basic physics of particle acceleration, conducted in those objects which can be most\n83\n\nfully characterized, and direct observational studies of candidate PeVatrons themselves. The latter project is\n84\n\nhampered by the large point-spread functions (PSFs) of Cherenkov detectors (of order a significant fraction\n85\n\nFrontiers\n3\n\nMori et al.\n\nof a degree), often containing multiple possible counterparts in the crowded Galactic plane. In the former\n86\n\napproach, one works to improve our knowledge of the basic physics of shock acceleration by studying\n87\n\nbetter-understood objects, but ones fairly certain not to be the PeVatrons themselves. The proposed HEX-P\n88\n\nmission can contribute on both fronts.\n89\n\nIn this paper, we present a wealth of HEX-P programs for investigating a diverse class of cosmic-ray\n90\n\naccelerators and exotic radioactive sources in our Galaxy. In §2, we review the key radiative processes as a\n91\n\nprimer for understanding multi-wavelength electromagnetic emission from cosmic-ray accelerators. §3 and\n92\n\n§4 describe the current telescope design and HEX-P’s primary observation program for Galactic cosmic-ray\n93\n\naccelerators, respectively. The HEX-P’s primary observation program has been optimally determined\n94\n\nbased on extensive simulations with the Simulations of X-ray Telescopes (SIXTE) suite and with NASA’s\n95\n\nHEASARC XSPEC software, as well as consulting with the current and future gamma-ray and neutrino\n96\n\ntelescope groups, including CTA, HAWC, VERITAS, IceCube, and COSI. Note that two primary classes of\n97\n\nGalactic particle accelerators, SNRs and PWNe, are discussed in a companion paper (Reynolds et al. 2023).\n98\n\n§5 discusses the unique and complementary role of HEX-P in the future multi-messenger observations\n99\n\nof Galactic PeVatrons, which is arguably the most exciting field in astroparticle physics currently and in\n100\n\nthe 2030s. §6 presents HEX-P observations of star clusters and superbubbles which represent a primary\n101\n\nclass of hadronic particle accelerators. §7 focuses on the HEX-P survey of W50 lobes, a unique particle\n102\n\naccelerator powered by the microquasar SS433. §8 presents how HEX-P observations can deepen our\n103\n\nunderstanding of intrabinary shock physics and interactions between pulsars and circumstellar disks in rare\n104\n\nTeV gamma-ray binaries. §9 concludes the paper with various HEX-P survey ideas in synergy with future\n105\n\ntelescopes in other wavelengths.\n106\n\n2\nRADIATIVE PROCESSES\n\nAccelerated particles make their presence known through a variety of radiative processes: synchrotron\n107\n\nradiation, bremsstrahlung, and inverse-Compton scattering for the electrons or positrons (leptonic\n108\n\nprocesses), and, for protons and nuclei, decay into gamma rays of π0 mesons produced in inelastic\n109\n\nscattering from target atoms (hadronic process).\n110\n\nRelativistic electrons (or positrons) of energy E radiating in a magnetic field B produce synchrotron\n111\n\nradiation with a spectrum peaking at photon energy Eγ = 15⟨BµG⟩E2\nPeV keV, after averaging over the\n112\n\nangle between B and the line of sight. These particles can also upscatter any ambient photon fields through\n113\n\ninverse-Compton scattering (ICS). Both cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and optical-IR\n114\n\n(OIR) photons can serve as relevant seed photon populations. The scattering cross-section is constant\n115\n\nat its Thomson value σT ≡6.65 × 10−25 cm2 for small values of the Klein-Nishina (KN) parameter\n116\n\nxKN ≡4E Eγi/(mec2)2, where Eγi is the seed photon energy. But as xKN approaches and exceeds 1,\n117\n\nthe cross-section decreases (Klein-Nishina suppression). The maximum outgoing photon energy Eγ is\n118\n\ngiven, for xKN ≪1, by Eγ = 4(E/mec2)2Eγi = xKNE, but as xKN approaches 1, Eγ asymptotes to E,\n119\n\nindependent of the seed photon energy. For CMB seeds (Eγi ∼2 meV), requiring xKN ≤0.1 to remain\n120\n\nsafely in the Thomson limit, the peak scattered photon energy is about 3 TeV, produced by electrons with\n121\n\nE ∼30 TeV. Higher-energy photons can be produced, but with decreasing efficiency. For OIR seeds\n122\n\n(Eγi ∼1 eV), again requiring xKN < 0.1 limits scattered photon energies to about 400 MeV, produced\n123\n\nby electrons with E ∼7 GeV. Thus ICS from the CMB can produce very high-energy (VHE, 100 GeV –\n124\n\n100 TeV) gamma-rays detectable with IACTs, while ICS from starlight seeds is most important below 1\n125\n\nGeV photon energies, observable with satellites. Finally, relativistic electrons can also produce relativistic\n126\n\nFrontiers\n4\n\nMori et al.\n\nbremsstrahlung with photon energies up to Eγ ∼E/3, but for the regions of parameter space relevant to\n127\n\nthe particle acceleration sources in this paper, bremsstrahlung is rarely dominant.\n128\n\nCosmic-ray protons and nuclei can produce gamma-ray emission through inelastic collisions with ambient\n129\n\ngas, resulting in the production of pions (hadronic process). The charged pions decay to secondary electrons\n130\n\nand positrons, while the π0 particles decay to gamma rays. These collisions result in a fixed ratio of gamma\n131\n\nrays to secondary leptons, an unavoidable consequence of the process. For kinematic reasons, pions cannot\n132\n\nbe produced until proton energies reach 140 MeV, at which point it becomes possible to produce π0’s with\n133\n\nEγ ≥70 MeV. The distinctive turn-on at this photon energy is the signature of the hadronic process.\n134\n\nThe synchrotron process does not contribute to gamma-ray emission, but it plays a crucial role in\n135\n\nproviding evidence for the highest-energy electrons. Electrons with energies above a few tens of TeV scatter\n136\n\nCMB photons much less efficiently, so their gamma-ray emission may be faint or lost below hadronic\n137\n\ngamma-ray processes. However, their maximum energy can be constrained through their synchrotron\n138\n\nradiation, in the energy range targeted by HEX-P.\n139\n\nThus a population of relativistic leptons and hadrons produces broadband emission from radio to above\n140\n\nPeV energies, through all four processes in general. Characterizing those populations requires observations\n141\n\nat all wavelengths, to create a spectral-energy distribution (SED). Radio emission, produced only by ∼\n142\n\nGeV-range electrons, can anchor the lepton distribution. The gamma-ray part of the spectrum above 70\n143\n\nMeV could be produced by two leptonic and one hadronic process, and sorting out which is responsible is\n144\n\nan essential task for the investigation of particle acceleration. Of particular interest are instruments capable\n145\n\nof observing very high-energy and ultra high-energy (UHE, > 100 TeV) gamma rays. While most of these\n146\n\ninstruments have angular resolutions of a significant fraction of a degree, the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n147\n\n(CTA), currently under construction and scheduled to begin full operation in the mid-2020s, is of particular\n148\n\ninterest for the HEX-P mission. Two CTA sites in the northern and southern hemispheres will be able to\n149\n\nsurvey the entire sky in the 0.1–100 TeV band with ∼1 arcmin angular resolution.\n150\n\nIn general, synchrotron X-ray emission (FX ∝ne · B2), ICS gamma-ray emission (Fγ ∝ne · nγ), and\n151\n\nhadronic gamma-ray emission (Fγ ∝np · nISM), where ne, nγ, np and nISM are electron, seed photon,\n152\n\nproton, and ISM densities, represent different components from the same underlying particle energy\n153\n\ndistribution (Figure 1). Hence, in numerous Galactic TeV sources, multiwavelength morphology and\n154\n\nSED studies with X-ray and IACT TeV data helped to distinguish between the leptonic and hadronic\n155\n\nscenarios and to constrain model parameters (Kargaltsev et al., 2013; Mori et al., 2021). For instance,\n156\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the distinct X-ray spectra expected in leptonic and hadronic models, despite predicting\n157\n\nnearly identical gamma-ray spectra. Additional constraints come from the fact that the same population of\n158\n\nrelativistic electrons can produce both synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission. The ratio of total power\n159\n\nradiated by an electron in the two processes is given by the ratio of magnetic-field energy density to seed\n160\n\nphoton energy density, i.e., Psynch/PIC = [(B2/8π)/urad]. The radiated spectra have the same slope up to\n161\n\npeak energies related to the maximum electron energy. The synchrotron peak depends on the magnetic\n162\n\nfield, while the IC peak depends on which seed photons are scattered. Therefore, the ratio of the peak\n163\n\nphoton energies can give an estimate of the magnetic-field strength, while the ratio of the peak fluxes there\n164\n\ncan give the magnetic-field filling factor (i.e., if the volume of radiating electrons is not uniformly filled\n165\n\nwith B). See Aharonian and Atoyan (1999) and Lazendic et al. (2004) for detailed expressions.\n166\n\nWhile gamma-ray detections provide evidence of particle acceleration, studying synchrotron X-ray\n167\n\nemission from primary and secondary electrons provides unique and complementary information to\n168\n\ngamma-ray observations. However, X-ray telescopes operating only below 10 keV are hampered by the\n169\n\nFrontiers\n5\n\nMori et al.\n\nFigure 1.

Right:\nExample leptonic (black) and hadronic (red) SED models for a hypothetical gamma-ray emitting particle\naccelerator. The two SED models with nearly identical gamma-ray spectra were produced using NAIMA\n(Zabalza, 2015). Note that the synchrotron X-ray spectra appear differently in both fluxes and slopes in the\nHEX-P bandpass (0.2–80 keV). The secondary electrons in the hadronic case are modeled following the\nrecipe of Kelner et al. (2006).\n\ncontamination by unrelated thermal X-ray components, which can hinder the detection of non-thermal\n170\n\nX-ray emission.\n171\n\n3\nHEX-P MISSION DESIGN AND SIMULATION\n\nThe High-Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P; Madsen+23) is a probe-class mission concept that offers sensitive\n172\n\nbroad-band coverage (0.2 −80 keV) of the X-ray spectrum with exceptional spectral, timing, and angular\n173\n\ncapabilities. It features two high-energy telescopes (HET) that focus hard X-rays, and a low-energy\n174\n\ntelescope (LET) providing soft X-ray coverage.\n175\n\nThe LET consists of a segmented mirror assembly coated with Ir on monocrystalline silicon that achieves\n176\n\na half power diameter of 3.5′′, and a low-energy DEPFET detector, of the same type as the Wide Field\n177\n\nImager (WFI; Meidinger et al. 2020) onboard Athena (Nandra et al., 2013). It has 512 x 512 pixels that\n178\n\ncover a field of view of 11.3′ × 11.3′. It has an effective bandpass of 0.2 −25 keV and a full-frame readout\n179\n\ntime of 2 ms, and can be operated in a 128 and 64 channel window mode for higher count-rates to mitigate\n180\n\npile-up and faster readout. Pile-up effects remain below an acceptable limit of ∼1% for sources up to\n181\n\n∼100 mCrab in the smallest window configuration (64w). Excising the core of the PSF, a common practice\n182\n\nin X-ray astronomy, will allow for observations of brighter sources, with a maximum loss of ∼60% of the\n183\n\ntotal photon counts.\n184\n\nThe HET consists of two co-aligned telescopes and detector modules. The optics are made of Ni-\n185\n\nelectroformed full shell mirror substrates, leveraging the heritage of XMM (Jansen et al., 2001), and coated\n186\n\nwith Pt/C and W/Si multilayers for an effective bandpass of 2 −80 keV. The high-energy detectors are of\n187\n\nthe same type as those flown on NuSTAR (Harrison et al., 2013), and they consist of 16 CZT sensors per\n188\n\nFrontiers\n6\n\nMori et al.\n\nfocal plane, tiled 4 × 4, for a total of 128 × 128 pixel spanning a field of view slightly larger than for the\n189\n\nLET, of 13.4′ × 13.4′.\n190\n\nAll the simulations presented here were produced with a set of response files that represent the observatory\n191\n\nperformance based on current best estimates (see Madsen+23). The effective area is derived from a ray-\n192\n\ntrace of the mirror design including obscuration by all known structures. The detector responses are\n193\n\nbased on simulations performed by the respective hardware groups, with an optical blocking filter for\n194\n\nthe LET and a Be window and thermal insulation for the HET. The LET background was derived from\n195\n\na GEANT4 simulation (Eraerds et al., 2021) of the WFI instrument, and the one for the HET from a\n196\n\nGEANT4 simulation of the NuSTAR instrument, both positioned at L1. Throughout the paper, we present\n197\n\nour simulation results for HEX-P using the SIXTE (Dauser et al., 2019) and XSPEC toolkits (Arnaud, 1996).\n198\n\nTo ensure the most realistic simulation results, we incorporated recent high-resolution X-ray images (mostly\n199\n\nfrom Chandra or other wavelength observations), the best-known spectral information, and theoretical\n200\n\nmodel predictions. Various exposure times have been considered for the feasibility studies presented in the\n201\n\nfollowing sections.\n202\n\n4\nHEX-P OBSERVATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nOne of the main objectives for the HEX-P mission is to comprehensively explore all types of cosmic-ray\n203\n\naccelerators in our Galaxy, including the recently discovered PeVatron candidates. HEX-P’s primary\n204\n\nmission will include observations of a diverse class of Galactic particle accelerators as outlined in Table\n205\n\n1. Broadly speaking, understanding particle acceleration, propagation, and cooling entails tackling four-\n206\n\ndimensional problems that involve spatial distribution (X, Y ), particle energy (E), and time (t). Modeling\n207\n\nand observing particle acceleration/injection sites serve as the initial step for this exploration. While pulsars\n208\n\nact as single-point central engines for producing PWNe, SNRs exhibit multiple acceleration sites, such as\n209\n\nforward and reverse shock waves. Once particles are accelerated and injected into the ambient medium,\n210\n\nthey propagate and lose kinetic energy through various mechanisms, including radiative loss, adiabatic\n211\n\ncooling, and collisions with the ISM and molecular clouds. Different regions away from the central engines\n212\n\ncontain particles injected at different times, requiring multi-zone investigations to track particle transport\n213\n\nand cooling. Resolving the multi-wavelength radiation from multiple regions is vital to grasp the entire\n214\n\npicture of how particle acceleration, propagation, and cooling interplay with each other. Furthermore, to\n215\n\nassess the contribution of specific types of particle accelerators to the local and global CR populations in\n216\n\nour Galaxy, it is crucial to examine objects at different stages of evolution.\n217\n\nTypically, energetic and powerful particle accelerators have been discovered through gamma-ray\n218\n\nobservations. Since the directional and intrinsic energy information of CRs is lost by the interstellar\n219\n\nmagnetic fields, the CR acceleration and propagation can only be probed indirectly through associated TeV\n220\n\ngamma-ray sources. While gamma-ray detections indicate the presence of particle acceleration, the limited\n221\n\nangular resolution of TeV gamma-ray telescopes often prevented source identifications. Multi-wavelength\n222\n\nobservations are required to determine source types and acceleration mechanisms, utilizing telescopes at\n223\n\nlower energies and with sub-arcminute angular resolutions.\n224\n\nWhile CTA is expected to revolutionize our views of Galactic particle accelerators in the TeV band, its\n225\n\nhigh-quality gamma-ray data alone cannot fully identify the source types and acceleration mechanisms\n226\n\nsince broader spectral data are required to separate out different potential emission components (ICS,\n227\n\npion-decay, and synchrotron radiation). It has long been realized that multi-wavelength observations\n228\n\nare crucial for identifying the sources and elucidating their emission/acceleration mechanisms. At lower\n229\n\nFrontiers\n7\n\nMori et al.\n\nenergies, X-ray and radio observations play a unique and complementary role to the gamma-ray data by\n230\n\ndetecting synchrotron radiation from GeV–PeV electrons. Furthermore, broad-band X-ray spectral data\n231\n\nprovide unique diagnostics for determining the highest energy cutoff region of hadronic PeVatrons far more\n232\n\nsensitively than gamma-ray and neutrino telescopes (Celli et al., 2020). To do this, the detailed shape of the\n233\n\nX-ray spectrum, in particular the existence of curvature or spectral breaks must be well characterized.\n234\n\nAbove all, the necessary condition for studying any particle accelerator in the X-ray band is the clean\n235\n\ndetection of non-thermal X-ray emission apart from soft, thermal X-rays. While previous and current X-ray\n236\n\ntelescopes such as NuSTAR achieved some success in this respect, HEX-P surpasses them as the ultimate\n237\n\nnon-thermal X-ray detector, given its unprecedented sensitivity above 10 keV. HEX-P excels in spatially\n238\n\nresolving thermal and non-thermal (synchrotron) X-ray emission, providing valuable broadband X-ray\n239\n\nmorphology and spectroscopy data. Moreover, determining the distribution of magnetic fields around the\n240\n\nacceleration sites is important for understanding particle transport and cooling processes. For example,\n241\n\nlow ambient B-fields may offer insights into why some PeVatron candidates seem to sustain extended TeV\n242\n\nemission without undergoing fast synchrotron cooling. Variability studies with HEX-P, as well as modeling\n243\n\nsmall-scale features, can constrain magnetic field strengths. HEX-P alone or in synergy with future TeV\n244\n\ntelescopes, provides the most powerful diagnostic tools to investigate the creation and propagation of\n245\n\nthe most energetic particles as well as their environments (e.g., magnetic field), ultimately shaping the\n246\n\nCR populations both below and above the knee at ∼3 PeV. A golden combination of HEX-P and CTA\n247\n\ncan usher in a new and exciting era of multi-zone and multi-wavelength approaches to studying Galactic\n248\n\nparticle accelerators.\n249\n\nBelow we summarize the primary HEX-P programs for studying a diverse class of Galactic particle\n250\n\naccelerators as well as for investigating nucleosynthesis in young SNRs and potential neutron-star mergers.\n251\n\nMore detailed descriptions and simulation results on each program can be found in the subsequent sections.\n252\n\n(1) Investigation of a variety of astrophysical shocks in the primary CR accelerators through\n253\n\nsynchrotron X-ray emission of TeV–PeV electrons: (1) DSA in SNRs, (2) PWN termination shock, (3)\n254\n\ninteractions between the SNR reverse shock and PWN, (4) intra-binary shock in gamma-ray binaries, (5)\n255\n\nmicroquasar jet-driven shock, (6) colliding wind shock in star clusters, and (7) supermassive blackhole\n256\n\nat Sgr A*. As outlined in Table 1, the primary science program will observe all these types of particle\n257\n\naccelerators and prompt follow-up HEX-P observations.\n258\n\n(2) Broad-band X-ray census of Galactic PeVatron candidates: In the most exciting and unexplored\n259\n\nregime of astroparticle physics, HEX-P will play a pivotal role in multi-messenger astrophysics by\n260\n\nidentifying Galactic PeVatrons and their acceleration/emission mechanisms in synergy with the upcoming\n261\n\nCTA observatory. Currently, 43 PeVatron candidates have been detected by LHAASO (Cao et al., 2023),\n262\n\nbut most of them have not yet been identified with known sources, and even the leptonic or hadronic\n263\n\nnature of the emission is not known. By the 2030s, more PeVatron candidates (at least ∼100) are expected\n264\n\nto be discovered. In addition, measuring the maximum particle energy exceeding ∼1 PeV is necessary\n265\n\nto establish that the LHAASO sources are indeed PeVatrons. HEX-P and CTA will determine both the\n266\n\naccelerator types and maximum particle energies through multi-wavelength SED studies.\n267\n\n(3) Providing a dynamic view of X-ray filaments and knots in young SNRs: HEX-P will be able\n268\n\nto detect year-scale variability from X-ray knots in young SNRs due to ongoing particle acceleration,\n269\n\nmagnetic field amplification, and fast synchrotron cooling (e.g., τ < 6 yr for electrons emitting synchrotron\n270\n\nX-rays at Eγ > 40 keV and B = 0.1 mG). HEX-P will identify the most energetic acceleration sites and\n271\n\ndetermine if young SNRs contain localized PeVatrons associated with hard X-ray knots.

This energy transformed into\nthe richly complex matter of which we and all we touch are made.  The Structure and\nEvolution of the Universe (SEU) theme within NASA’s Office of Space Science seeks to\nexplore and understand the dynamic transformations of energy in the Universe—the en-\ntire web of biological and physical interactions that determine the evolution of our cosmic\nhabitat.  This search for understanding will enrich the human spirit and inspire a new\ngeneration of explorers, scientists, and engineers.\nThis roadmap is about the future of the SEU theme.  Many science objectives encom-\npassed by the SEU theme have been given high priority by the science community through\nworking groups, roadmap teams, and strategic planning processes.  This roadmap draws\nupon broad community input, including the specific recommendations of recent consen-\nsus reports of the National Academy of Sciences such as Astronomy and Astrophysics in\nthe New Millennium (2001) and Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos (2002).\nMany of the community’s science priorities could be realized within the next 25 years.\nThis roadmap recognizes that, within the resources available, not all of these science ob-\njectives can be undertaken immediately.  Constructing a roadmap clearly entails making\nhard choices.\nIn this roadmap, the science objectives for SEU are presented and prioritized.  The\nresearch programs and space missions required to address the science objectives are iden-\ntified.  The roadmap lays out a path that begins at the completion of the present program\nand leads to the future.\nThe SEU theme’s highest priorities are presented\nin the Beyond Einstein program (Part I).  A  roadmap\nis presented for realizing these objectives starting\nnow.  The science objectives described in the Cycles\nof Matter and Energy program (Part II) are presented\nwith the understanding that this program will be\nundertaken after Beyond Einstein has begun.  Part\nIII details continuing activities vital to maintaining\nthe technical base to implement these missions and\ndevelop future ones.\n\n4\n\nHubble Space Telescope image of the jet of plasma moving at relativistic\nspeed away from the supermassive black hole at the center of the nearby galaxy\nMessier 87.\n\n5\n\nFrom the Big Bang to Black Holes\n\nHow did the Universe begin?  Does time have a beginning and an end?  Does space have\nedges?  Einstein’s theory of relativity replies to these ancient questions with three startling\npredictions: that the Universe is expanding from a Big Bang; that black holes so distort\nspace and time that time stops at their edges; and that a dark energy could be pulling\nspace apart, sending galaxies forever beyond the edge of the visible Universe.  Observa-\ntions confirm these remarkable predictions, the last finding only four years ago.  Yet\nEinstein’s legacy is incomplete.  His theory raises—but cannot answer—three profound\nquestions:\n\n• What powered the Big Bang?\n• What happens to space, time, and matter at the edge of a black hole?\n• What is the mysterious dark energy pulling the Universe apart?\n\nThe Beyond Einstein program aims to answer these questions.  It will employ a series\nof missions linked by powerful new technologies and complementary approaches to shared\nscience goals.\n\nEinstein Great Observatories: Facility-class missions\n\n• Constellation-X: Uses X-ray-emitting atoms as clocks to follow matter\nfalling into black holes and to study the evolution of the Universe.\n• The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA): Uses gravitational waves\n to sense directly the changes in space and time around black holes and to\n measure the structure of the Universe.\n\nThese missions are ready to pioneer technologies and approaches needed for the\nVision Missions to reach the ends of space and time.\n\nEinstein Probes: Fully competed, moderate-sized, scientist-led missions launched every\nthree years\n\n• Dark Energy Probe: Determine the properties of the dark energy that domi-\nnates the Universe.\n• Inflation Probe: Detect the imprints left by quantum effects and gravita-\ntional waves at the beginning of the Big Bang.\n• Black Hole Probe: Take a census of black holes in the local Universe.\n\nThese missions will answer sharply focused questions. Competition ensures\nflexibility and keeps costs low by selecting methods and technologies.\n\nPrograms of technology development and research in preparation for two “Vision\nMissions” reaching to the ends of space and time\n\n• A Big Bang Observer to detect directly gravitational waves echoing from\nthe earliest moments of the Big Bang.\n• A Black Hole Imager to image directly matter near the edge of a black\nhole and map its motion.\n\nBeyond Einstein fascinates the American public and compels the attention of the news\nmedia and the entertainment industry.  Beyond Einstein amplifies this fascination, devel-\noping an education component that enthralls students and is aligned with national stan-\ndards.

The pro-\ngram will study the building blocks of our own existence at the most basic\nlevel: the matter, energy, space, and time that create the living Universe.  Be-\nyond Einstein missions will extend the reach of humanity to the ultimate ex-\ntremes: the birth of the Universe, the edges of space and time near black holes,\nand the darkest spaces between the galaxies.  Together these studies will help\nus understand how the matter and energy of the Universe come to life.\n\nBeyond Einstein missions will connect humans to the vast Universe far beyond\nthe Solar System, to the entirety of creation.  They will extend our senses be-\nyond what we can imagine today: to the largest and smallest things, the begin-\nnings and ends of time and space.  The images and knowledge gained in this\nquest will inspire all humanity—as only NASA can.\n\nBeyond Einstein Science Objectives and Research Focus Areas.\n\nNASA Agency Goal: Explore the Solar System and the Universe beyond.\n\nScience Objective 1.

Bartusiak in\nEinstein's Unfinished\nSymphony\n\n11\n\nChapter 1. Executive Summary\n\nHow did the Universe begin?  Does time have a beginning and an end?  Does space have\nedges?  The questions are clear and simple.  They are as old as human curiosity.  But the\nanswers have always seemed beyond the reach of science.  Until now.\nIn their attempts to understand how space, time, and matter are connected, Einstein\nand his successors made three predictions.  First, space is expanding from a Big Bang;\nsecond, space and time can tie themselves into contorted knots called “black holes” where\ntime actually comes to a halt; third, space itself contains some kind of energy that is pull-\ning the Universe apart.  Each of these three predictions seemed so fantastic when it was\nmade that everyone, including Einstein himself, regarded them as unlikely.  Incredibly, all\nthree have turned out to be true.  Yet Einstein’s legacy is one of deep mystery, because his\ntheory is silent on three questions raised by his fantastic predictions: (1) What powered the\nBig Bang?  (2) What happens to space, time, and matter at the edge of a black hole?  (3)\nWhat is the mysterious dark energy pulling the Universe apart?\nTo find answers, we must venture beyond Einstein.  The answers require new theories,\nsuch as the inflationary universe and new insights in high-energy particle theory.  Like\nEinstein’s theory, these make fantastic predictions that seem hard to believe: new unseen\ndimensions and entire universes beyond our own.  We must find facts to confront and\nguide these new theories.  Powerful new technologies now make this possible.\nHere is where the Beyond Einstein story starts.   By exploring the three questions that\nare Einstein’s legacy, we begin the next revolution in understanding our Universe.  We\nchart our way forward using clues from observations and from new ideas connecting the\nworlds of the very small and the very large.\n\nWhat powered the Big Bang?\n\nDuring the last decade, sky maps of the radiation relic of the Big Bang—first by NASA’s\nCosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite and more recently by other experiments,\nincluding Antarctic balloon flights and NASA’s Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP)—\nhave displayed the wrinkles imprinted on the Universe in its first moments.  Gravity has\npulled these wrinkles into the lumpy Universe of galaxies and planets we see today.  Yet\n\nMAP Simulation\nThe MAP Explorer\nmission provides the\nclearest view yet of\nthe cosmic microwave\nbackground, using the\nwrinkles imprinted\nupon it from the\nearliest moments of\nthe big bang to\nprovide precision\nmeasurements on the\nexpansion and\ncontents of the\nUniverse.\n\nSimulation of the map of the cosmic microwave background that is being obtained by NASA’s\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (MAP).\n\n12\n\nstill unanswered are the questions: why was the Universe so smooth before, and what\nmade the tiny but all-important wrinkles in the first place?\nEinstein’s theories led to the Big Bang model, but they are silent on these questions as\nwell as the simplest: “What powered the Big Bang?”  Modern theoretical ideas that try to\nanswer these questions predict that the wrinkles COBE discovered arose from two kinds\nof primordial particles: of the energy field that powered the Big Bang; and gravitons,\nfundamental particles of space and time.\nMeasurements by missions of the Beyond Einstein program could separate these dif-\nferent contributions, allowing us to piece together the story of how time, space, and en-\nergy worked together to power the Big Bang.\n\nWhat happens to space, time, and  matter at the edge of a black hole?\n\nThe greatest extremes of gravity in the Universe today are the black holes\nformed at the centers of galaxies and by the collapse of stars.  These invisible\nbodies can be studied by examining matter swirling into them, and by listen-\ning to the waves of distortion they make in spacetime.  New data from X-ray\nsatellites, such as NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA’s XMM-New-\nton, show signs of gas whizzing about black holes at close to the speed of light\nand hint that time is slowing as the gas plunges into the zone from which\n\nMost of the X-ray sources seen in this 12-day exposure by the Chandra\nX-ray Observatory are active galaxies and quasars powered by massive\nblack holes. Ground-based observations show that many of them are\nshrouded by dust; many others remain unidentified, invisible except in\nX-rays.\n\nQuantum fluctuations during the Big Bang are imprinted in gravitational waves, the\ncosmic microwave background, and in the structure of today’s Universe.  Studying the\nBig Bang means detecting those imprints.\n\n13\n\nescape is impossible.  Beyond Einstein missions will\ntake a census of black holes in the Universe and give\ndetailed pictures of what happens to space and time\nat the edges of these roiling vortices.\nBeyond Einstein missions will listen to the sounds\nof spacetime carried by a new form of energy, pre-\ndicted by Einstein, called gravitational waves.  We\nwill hear the booming, hissing, and humming of col-\nliding and merging black holes and other extreme\nflows of matter throughout the Universe.  These\nsounds will detail the conversion of matter and en-\nergy into warps in space and time.  The measurements of gravitational waves will provide\na new way of understanding the behavior of space and time near black holes and take us\nbeyond to a new understanding of spacetime singularities.\nEinstein himself never dreamed that it would be possible to detect these waves, which\nonly vary the distance between objects as far apart as the Earth and Moon by less than the\nwidth of an atom.  Yet the technology now exists to do so.\n\nWhat is the mysterious dark energy pulling the Universe apart?\n\nA landmark discovery of the 1990s was that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating.\nThe source of this mysterious force opposing gravity we call “dark energy.”\nBecause he originally thought the Universe was static, Einstein conjectured that even\nthe emptiest possible space, devoid of matter and radiation, might still have a dark energy,\nwhich he called a “Cosmological Constant.”  When Edwin Hubble discovered the expan-\nsion of the Universe, Einstein rejected his own idea, calling it his greatest blunder.\nAs Richard Feynman and others developed the quantum theory of matter,\nthey realized that “empty space” was full of temporary (“virtual”) particles\ncontinually forming and destroying themselves.  Physicists began to suspect\nthat indeed the vacuum ought to have a dark form of energy, but they could not\npredict its magnitude.\nThrough recent measurements of the expansion of the Universe, astrono-\nmers have discovered that Einstein’s “blunder” was not a blunder: some form\nof dark energy does indeed appear to dominate the total mass-energy content\nof the Universe, and its weird repulsive gravity is pulling the Universe apart.\n\nRichard Feynman [Nobel Prize, 1965]\nshowed that “empty” space was filled with\nvirtual particles.\n\n“I found it very ugly indeed that the field law of gravitation should be\ncomposed of two logically independent terms which are connected by\naddition.  About the justification of such feelings concerning logical sim-\nplicity it is difficult to argue.  I cannot help to feel it strongly and I am\nunable to believe that such an ugly thing should be realized in nature.”\n—Albert Einstein, in a Sept. 26, 1947, letter to Georges Lemaître\n\n“In modern physics,\nthe vacuum is simply\nthe lowest energy state\nof the system.  It need\nnot be empty nor\nuninteresting, and its\nenergy is not neces-\nsarily zero.”\n—From Quarks to\nCosmos,\nReport of the\nCommittee on the\nPhysics of the\nUniverse\n\n14\n\nWe still do not know whether or how the highly accelerated expansion in the early\nUniverse (inflation) and the current  accelerated expansion (due to dark energy)\nare related.\nA Beyond Einstein mission will measure the expansion accurately enough to learn\nwhether this energy is a constant property of empty space (as Einstein conjectured), or\nwhether it shows signs of the richer structure that is possible in modern unified theories of\nthe forces of nature.\n\nThe Beyond Einstein Program\n\nThe Beyond Einstein program has three linked elements which advance science and tech-\nnology towards two visions: to detect directly gravitational wave signals from the earliest\npossible moments of the Big Bang, and to image the event horizon of a black hole.  The\ncentral element is a pair of Einstein Great Observatories, Constellation-X and LISA.  These\npowerful facilities will blaze new paths to the questions about black holes, the Big Bang,\nand dark energy.  They will also address other central goals of contemporary astrophysics\n(discussed in Part II of this roadmap).  The second element is a series of competitively\nselected Einstein probes, each focused on one of the science questions.  The third element\nis a program of technology development, theoretical studies, and education, to support the\nProbes and the vision missions: the Big Bang Observer and the Black Hole Imager.  The\nprogram offers competitive opportunities for mission leadership, technology development,\nand groundbreaking scientific research, with goals that excite the public.\n\nEinstein Great Observatories\n\nWhile these two missions are focused on specific observational goals, the capabilities they\nprovide are so dramatically new that they will also provide a broad science return that will\nimpact all areas of astrophysics, as have Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory before them.\nThe Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will deploy three spacecraft or-\nbiting the Sun, separated from each other by five million kilometers (17 light seconds).\nEach spacecraft will contain freely falling “proof masses” protected from all forces other\nthan gravity.  The relative motion of the masses can be measured to sub-nanometer accu-\nracy by combining laser beams shining between the spacecraft.  Passing gravitational\nwaves will ripple space and time, revealing their\npresence by altering the motion of the proof masses.\nLISA will probe space and time at the forming\nedges of black holes by listening to the sounds of\nvibrating spacetime: the booming roar of\nsupermassive black holes merging, the chorus of\ndeath cries from stars on close orbits around black\nholes, and the ripping noise of zipping singularities.\nIt may even hear whispers from the time in the early\nUniverse when our three-dimensional space formed\nwithin the now unseen space of six or seven di-\nmensions.  LISA will plot the orbits of stars around\nblack holes to test Einstein’s theory under extreme\nconditions.\nLISA measurements of merging black holes\nwill provide a new yardstick with which to mea-\n\nLISA\n\n15\n\nsure the Universe and constrain the nature of dark energy.  LISA will also measure waves\nfrom black holes in the first structures of the Universe to collapse.  It will measure gravi-\ntational waves from thousands of binary star systems in our Galaxy, yielding new\ninsights into the formation and evolution of binary stars.\nThe Constellation-X mission will consist of four 1.6-meter X-ray telescopes orbiting\nthe Earth/Sun system, providing nearly 100 times the sensitivity of the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory and other planned missions for X-ray spectroscopy.  They will be instru-\nmented to cover a range of more than a factor of 100 in X-ray energy with unprecedented\nenergy resolution.\nConstellation-X will address the question, “What happens to matter at the edge of a\nblack hole?”  When plasma streams collide at nearly the speed of light, they become hot\nenough to emit X rays.  The vibrations of the X-ray light act as clocks that we can use to\ntrack the motions of the plasma and the distortions\nof space and time near the black hole.  The great\nsensitivity of Constellation-X will allow us to make\n“slow-motion movies” of the gas at a high frame\nrate.  Current instruments are not sensitive enough\nfor the short exposures needed to freeze the mo-\ntion.\nConstellation-X will dramatically increase our\nability to obtain high resolution X-ray spectroscopy\nof faint X-ray sources.  This will enable us to con-\nstrain the nature of dark matter and dark energy by\nobserving their effects on the formation of clusters\nof galaxies.  These measurements, and those by the\nDark Energy Probe, LISA, and the Inflation Probe,\nwill each constrain different possible properties of\ndark energy and together lead to its understanding.\nConstellation-X’s high resolution spectra will pro-\nvide fresh diagnostics of the speed, density, tem-\nperature, and composition of plasma in galaxies and\nexotic stars throughout the Universe, allowing new studies of their nature and evolution.\nBlack holes grow both by accreting gas and by accreting stars.  They change both by\nejecting gas and by merging with other black holes.  To understand the origin and nature of\nthe giant black holes in the centers of galaxies requires both LISA and Constellation-X,\nworking together to cover all four of these processes.\n\nEinstein Probes\n\nComplementing the facility-class Einstein Great Observatories, a series of sharply fo-\ncused missions will address those critical science goals that do not require facility-class\nmissions.  For these missions, the science question is defined strategically but the science\napproach and mission concept will be determined through peer review.  We identify three\ncompelling questions whose answers can take us beyond Einstein.\n“How did the Universe begin?”  Scientists believe the Universe began with a period\nof “inflation,” when the Universe expanded so rapidly that parts of it separated from other\nparts faster than the speed of light.  Inflation theory predicts that this expansion was pro-\npelled by a quantum-mechanical energy of the vacuum similar to the dark energy today.  It\nmay hold the answer to the question, “What powered the Big Bang?”  One way to test this\n\nConstellation-X\n\n16\n\nMany NASA missions have laid the groundwork for the Beyond Einstein pro-\ngram, and will complement it.  NASA’s COBE discovered the first evidence\nfor primordial density fluctuations in the CMB.  NASA’s balloon program (e.g.,\nthe NASA/NSF/Italian/UK BOOMERanG) has supported the discovery of the\ninteraction of those fluctuations with matter in the Universe.  NASA’s MAP\nsatellite and the ESA’s planned Planck satellite will extend these discoveries\nand are vital precursors to the proposed Inflation Probe.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has helped to find and measure the distant\nsupernovae that have forced us to accept the reality of dark energy.\nX-ray missions, including NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and RXTE,\nESA’s XMM-Newton, and Japan’s ASCA, have discovered X rays from matter\nspiraling into black holes, illustrating the potential of Constellation-X.\nGravity Probe B will test one of Einstein’s exotic predictions: that the rota-\ntion of the Earth drags space and time around the Earth into a mild version of\nthe tremendous vortical spin near a spinning black hole.\nSwift will study gamma-ray bursts, believed to be a result of the stellar\nexplosions and mergers which create black holes.  Swift will also test technol-\nogy for the Black Hole Finder Probe.\nGLAST will provide more sensitivity and energy coverage than ever be-\nfore for the study of high-energy emissions from particles accelerated in gamma-\nray bursts and in the jets from spinning black holes in galactic nuclei.\nJapan/NASA’s Astro-E2 will be the first to use NASA-provided micro-\ncalorimeters that are prototypes for Constellation-X detectors.\nST-7 and  ESA’s SMART-2 will provide a flight comparison of two distur-\nbance reduction technologies competing for use on LISA.\n\nidea is to look for relics of quantum fluctuations.  Gravitational waves are the most direct\nrelics since they penetrate the heat and density of those early days.\nIt is technically feasible to look for the quantum effect of gravitational waves and\ndistinguish them from the quantum effects of the primordial energy,  by examining their\ndistinctive effects on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.  An “Inflation\nProbe” with this capability will help define the nature of the vacuum that drove inflation.\n“How did black holes form and grow?”  Most astronomers believe that the black\nholes in the centers of galaxies grew by swallowing stars and gas, emitting light in the\nprocess.  But there is an accounting problem: not enough light is coming from black holes\nin active galaxies to explain their growth.  There are hints that much of the growth oc-\ncurred behind a veil of dust.  One way to see into these dark corners is to use the most\npenetrating of X rays.  The “Black Hole Finder Probe” will perform a census of hidden\nblack holes, revealing the demographics and life cycles of black holes and identifying\nblack holes for study with Constellation-X.  Combining these data with studies of accre-\ntion by Constellation-X and of black hole mergers by LISA will reveal how giant black\nholes formed.\n“What is the mysterious energy pulling the Universe apart?” is a question that would\nnot have been asked five years ago, before there was evidence that the Universe was being\npulled apart.  To understand this energy, we must measure the expansion of the Universe\nwith high precision.  This will require the most precise cosmic yardsticks we can find.\n\nGravitational waves\nare vibrations in the\nfabric of space and\ntime.  Gravitons are\ntheir quanta.  Unlike\nphotons (the quanta of\nlight), gravitons hardly\ninteract at all with\nmatter, so our senses\nhave never before\ndetected them.  The\nlight we see from the\nBig Bang, the\nCosmic Microwave\nBackground, last\nbounced off matter\nwhen the Universe\nwas 300,000 years\nold.  Gravitons from\nthe Big Bang have\nbeen hurtling toward\nus unchanged since\nthe Universe was 10-35\n\nseconds old!\n\n17\n\nSeveral ideas for such “Dark Energy Probes” have been proposed—for example, preci-\nsion measurement of distant supernovae by a wide-field space telescope.\nIndependent diagnostics of the dark energy will be crucial to verify the validity of\nresults and to increase the precision of the measurements.  The Inflation Probe and LISA\nwill provide completely independent cosmic yardsticks with which to measure the effects\nof dark energy, and Constellation-X will observe the first clusters of galaxies whose evo-\nlution depends critically on dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe Ultimate Vision\n\nThe technology to go far beyond Einstein is within our reach if we approach the grand\ngoals systematically, mission building upon mission, proving and refining the required\ntechnology.  Strategic investments in hardware, software, and astrophysical theory will\nlead the way forward to two visions:\nTo explore the beginning of time, a “Big Bang Observer” will build upon LISA to\ndirectly measure gravitons from the early Universe still present today.  In contrast to\nthe Inflation Probe’s measurement of frozen imprints of much longer waves on the micro-\nwave background, the Big Bang Observer will observe gravitational waves in their origi-\n\nThe dark energy filling\nyour house has just\nenough energy for a\nflea to make one jump.\nYet across the\nimmense volume of\nthe Universe, this\nenergy can overcome\nthe gravitational\nattraction of all the\nbillions of galaxies.\n\n18\n\nnal form, from still earlier in the Big Bang.  The Big Bang Observer would give us a direct\nview of the creation of spacetime, a truly profound achievement.\nTo explore the end of time and the edges of space, Constellation-X will measure the\nspectral signatures of gas swirling into black holes, and LISA will record the tune to which\nstars dance around it.  But there is no substitute for a direct image.  A “Black Hole Imager”\nbased on X-ray interferometry could take this epochal picture, revealing directly the fate\nof matter near a black hole.\n\nTechnology\n\nWhile the enabling foundations are well in hand, the Beyond Einstein program demands\nmany refinements in technology.  Constellation-X will need lightweight optics and cryo-\ngenic X-ray calorimeters.  LISA needs sensitive monitoring units coupled to\nmicronewton thrusters to keep its test masses free of non-gravitational forces.  It\nwill also require very stable laser measurement systems.  The Einstein Probes require\nstudy of a broad range of technologies so that the most effective approach to their science\n\nThe Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) is the highest priority\nmission already under development in the Structure and Evolution of the Uni-\nverse theme.  This roadmap assumes its completion and scheduled launch in\n2006.  GLAST is an international and multi-agency (NASA and DOE) project.\n\nGLAST builds upon the succes",

        "full_text": "Neutrino Astronomy An Introduction to Neutrino Astronomy Neutrino Astronomy Almost all we know about the universe derives from the\nobservation of photons.  Radio waves (and radar), infrared (used\nby night-vision goggles and heat-seeking missles), visible\nlight, ultra violet waves like those that give you a suntan,\nX-rays and the powerful and deadly gamma rays such as those now\nseen coming from neutron stars, are all electromagnetic waves\ncomposed of photons.  We are learning some further things about\nthe cosmos beyond the solar system by observing cosmic rays,\nwhich are mostly made up of either atomic nuclei minus their\norbiting electrons, or one of their basic components, protons. \nBut these positively charged particles do not point to their\nplace of origin due to the magnetic fields of our galaxy which\naffect their flight paths like a magnet affects iron filings. What is needed for deep, sharply focused examination of the\nuniverse is a telescope that can see a particle that is not much\naffected by the gas, dust, and swirling magnetic fields it\npasses on its journey.  Neutrinos are a candidate.  They\nconstitute much of the total number of elementary particles in\nthe universe, and these neutral weakly interacting particles\n(see section NEUTRINO) come to us almost without any disruption\nstraight from their sources, traveling at very close to the\nspeed of light.  A (low energy) neutrino in flight would not\nnotice a barrier of lead fifty light years thick.  When we are\nable to see outwards in neutrino light we will doubtless get a\nwondrous new view of the universe. Neutrinos in the Universe The fundamental building blocks of the universe of which all\nmatter is composed, consist of Fermions: the quarks (up, down,\ncharmed, strange, top and bottom) and leptons (electron, muon\nand tau-on, plus a neutral particle partner for each,\nelectron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tau-neutrino).  As a result\nof data from the Super-Kamiokande experiment presented in 1998,\nwe now know with high probability that some neutrinos have mass,\nand thus so do all the Fermions.  One of the greatest challenges\nto elementary particle physics is now to explain the great gap\nbetween neutrino masses and those of the electrically charged\nfundamental Fermions (a factor of more than a hundred billion). Neutrinos were made in staggering numbers at the time of the Big\nBang.  Like the cosmic background radiation (see section on\nthis) the neutrinos now posess little kinetic energy (the energy\nof motion that is to say, like the energy of an incoming meteor)\ndue to expansion of the universe.  There are expected to be at\nleast 114 neutrinos per cubic centimeter, averaged over all\nspace.  There could be many more at earth because of\ncondensation of neutrinos, now moving slowly under the\ngravitational pull of our galaxy.  As of now, we only have a\nlower limit on the total mass in this free floating ghostly gas\nof neutrinos, but even so it is roughly equivalent to the total\nmass of all the visible stars in the universe. These relic neutrinos would be wonderful to observe, and much\nthought has gone into seeking ways to do so.  The problem is\nthat the probability of neutrinos interacting within a detector\ndecreases with the square of the neutrino's energy, for low\nenergies.  And even in the rare case when the neutrino does\nreact in the detector the resulting signal is frustratingly\nminiscule.  Nobody has been able to detect these lowest energy\nneutrinos as yet.  Prospects are not good for a low-energy\nneutrino telescope, at least in the near future. Stellar Neutrinos Next best are neutrinos from the nuclear burning of stars.  Here\nwe are more fortunate, as we have the sun close by producing a\nhuge flux (number per unit area per unit time) of neutrinos,\nwhich have been detected now in five experiments (see SOLAR\nNEUTRINOS).  A thirty year mystery persists in the deficit of\nabout a half in the numbers of neutrinos detected compared to\nexpectations, the so-called \"Solar Neutrino Problem\". This\ndeficit is now thought probably to be due to neutrino\noscillations.  Really, the fact of calculating the expected\nneutrino flux from our sun and getting the answer to be close to\nobservations represents a great triumph for our understanding of\nstellar burning and evolution.  So, in this sense we are already\ndoing neutrino astronomy.  However, we are limited to the sun. \nJust as the sky is dark at night despite all the stars, the sun\noutshines all the rest of the cosmos in numbers of neutrinos we\ndetect. Supernovae A marvelous event occurred at 07:35:41 GMT on 23 February 1987, when\ntwo detectors in deep mines in the US (the IMB experiment) and Japan\n(the Kamiokande experiment) recorded a total of 19 neutrino\ninteractions over a span of 13 seconds.  Two and a half hours later\n(but reported sooner) astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere saw the\nfirst Supernova to be visible with the unaided eye since the time of\nKepler, 250 years ago, and this occurred in the Large Magellanic\nClouds at a distance of some 50 kiloparsecs (roughly 150,000 light\nyears).  From this spectacular beginning to neutrino astronomy\nfollowed many deductions about the nature of neutrinos, such as limits\non mass, charge, gravitational attraction, magnetic moment, and so on,\nand several hundred publications.  Never had so much science and\nastronomy been extracted from so few events.  Supernovae of the\ngravitational collapse type, occur when elderly stars run out of\nnuclear fusion energy and can no longer resist the force of gravity.\nThe neutrinos wind up carrying off most of the in-fall energy, some 10%\nof the total mass-energy of the inner part of star of about 1.4 solar\nmasses.  Approximately 3 x 10^53 ergs get released with about 10^58\nneutrinos over a few seconds.  This is a staggering thousand times the\nsolar energy release over its whole lifetime!  The awesome visible\nfireworks consist of a mere one thousandth of the energy release in\nneutrinos. Much can yet be learned from the death throes of stars, not only about\nthe process of stellar collapse to a neutron star or black hole (the\nlatter if the progenitor is very massive), but also about properties\nof neutrinos.  For example, heavier neutrinos travel more slowly and\nby studying the structure of the neutrino wave passing by earth, we\ncan perhaps extract the relative masses of the three types of\nneutrinos in a direct way, aside from that of the phenomenon of\nneutrino oscillations.  As of this time (1999), four underground\ndetectors (Super-Kamiokande in Japan, SNO in Canada, LVD, and MACRO in\nItaly) have significant capability for supernova detection from our\ngalaxy.  The rate of visible supernovae in our galaxy is only about\none per 200 years from historical information, but many cannot be seen\noptically due to the obscuration of the galactic plane.  From\nhistorical records and from observations of distant spiral galaxies we\nexpect the rate of supernovae in our galaxy to be between one per\ntwenty and one hundred years.  Thus experimentalists may have to wait\na long time before the next observation, and we have no way of\npredicting when it will occur. High Energy Cosmic Neutrinos Moving up in energy, physicists have realized for many years that\nhigher energy neutrinos would be made inevitably in many of the most\nluminous and energetic objects in the universe.  The most powerful\nobjects seen are active galactic nuclei, which are known to produce\nparticles with energies much higher than the most powerful\nhuman-constructed particle accelerators.  There also exist enigmatic\nobjects such as Gamma Ray Bursters, which may be the most energetic\nexplosions observed and which are mostly at cosmological distances.\nThese produce gamma rays up to great energies as well, and may be\nbountiful neutrino sources or maybe not, depending upon the mechanism\nfor the radiation, at present a mystery.  Seemingly disallowed cosmic\nrays have been observed in recent years, with energies more than a 100\nmillion times greater than terrestrial accelerators (more than 10^20\neV). These\nmysterious particles apparently do not come from our galaxy, and\nindeed remain of unknown origin.  In fact, after nearly a century of\nstudy, we do not know the origin of the cosmic rays generally,\nparticularly above about 1 PeV (10^15 eV), though many models have\nbeen proposed.  Whatever the source, the machinery which accelerates\nparticles to the higher energies will inevitably also produce\nneutrinos.  At the highest energies many speculative models have been\nproposed as neutrino sources, including decays of Planck mass objects\nleft over from the Big Bang, radiation from around super-conducting\ncosmic strings and the like, exciting findings if verified, and of\nfundamental importance to particle physics and cosmology. Thus we know that high energy neutrinos surely arrive to us from the\ncosmos, and may teach us much as we study their directions, energy,\ntype and variation with time.  The burning question for would-be\nneutrino astronomers is however, are there enough neutrinos to detect?\nTwo things make prospects more bright in the near future for higher\nenergy neutrino astronomy than lower energies. First the interaction probability for neutrinos goes up with energy.\nFor the largest present underground detector, Super-Kamiokande, only\nabout one in a trillion neutrinos of the typical energy (about 1 GeV,\nor the equivalent to the proton rest mass) interact when passing\nthrough the detector and can be studied.  This goes up almost in\nproportion to the energy of the neutrino however.  In fact above about\n1 PeV, the earth is opaque to neutrinos and one must look for\nneutrinos only coming downwards.  At lower energies one does neutrino\nastronomy backwards from optical astronomy, looking downwards, using\nthe earth to filter out anything but neutrinos.  It is this region\nbetween 1 TeV (10^12 eV) and 1 PeV, roughly, that is the favorite\nhunting ground for attempts to begin regular neutrino astronomy. The second virtue of seeking higher rather than lower energy neutrinos\nis that the consequences of neutrino interaction with a target (earth\nor detector) become more detectable as the energy release is greater.\nThe favored method is to detect muons produced by neutrinos.  These\nmuons (unlike electrons or tau-ons) fly a long distance (in closely the\nsame direction as the neutrino) in earth before stopping, for example\nabout one kilometer at an energy of a few TeV.  These charged\nparticles produce Cherenkov radiation, a short flash of light\ndetectable at tens of meters distance by photomultipliers in clear\nwater or ice.  Cherenkov radiation occurs when particles exceed the\nvelocity of light in the medium (75% of c in this case), and which is\nrather like an electromagnetic version of a sonic boom, or the wake of\na ship.  Thus a detector can effectively collect the  results of\nneutrino interactions from a target volume much greater than the\ndetector volume itself. High Energy Neutrino Telescopes Neutrino detectors must be generally placed deep underground or water\nto escape the backgrounds caused by the inescapable rain of cosmic\nrays upon the atmosphere.  The cosmic rays produce many muons which\npenetrate deeply into the earth, in even the deepest mines, but of\ncourse with ever decreasing numbers with depth.  Hence the first\nattempts at high energy neutrino astronomy have been initiated\nunderwater and under ice.  The lead project, called DUMAND was\ncanceled in 1995 on account of slow progress and budget difficulties,\nbut managed to make great headway in pioneering techniques, studying\nbackgrounds, exploring detector designs, and perhaps most importantly\nstimulating the community to consider neutrinos in astrophysics.\nAnother long running project exists in Lake Baikal, the largest and\ndeepest lake in the world, in Siberia.  That instrument consists of\nlarge light detectors (0.4 m diameter) lowered on cables from the\nwinter ice and connected to shore by cable. The Baikal project has\nreached a level of producing some modest physics results, including\natmospheric neutrino detections, but is still a few years from\nsignificant neutrino astronomy since the present area amounts to only\na few hundred square meters. Two projects similar to DUMAND are underway in the Mediterranean, the\nmore developed NESTOR Project located off Pylos in the Southwest of\nGreece, and the new ANTARES Project located offshore from Marseilles,\nFrance. Another project is being talked about for southern Italy as\nwell.  These projects differ in the method of supporting\nphoto-detectors and array geometry, but basically employ the same\nmethod of bottom anchored cables with photomultipliers protected in\nspherical glass pressure housings, as developed for DUMAND. Both\nprojects aim at prototype neutrino detectors in the near future\n(several years, with NESTOR a bit ahead).  The prototype instruments\nwill have effective areas for muon collection in the range of 20-50\nthousand m^2 area.  This may be compared with the largest present\nunderground instruments which are about 1000 m^2 area, and the desired\nsize for real astronomy of about one million m^2 (a square kilometer). The deep ocean water is amazingly clear with optical attenuation\nlengths of 40-50 meters.  Instruments can be spaced a few tens of\nmeters apart to detect most muons passing nearby.  An array of\nvertical strings of such detectors can cover a whole cubic kilometer\nemploying roughly the same number of detectors as in the existing\nSuper-Kamiokande deep mine instrument.  Of course, placing these\nphoto-detectors in the deep ocean is much more tricky and costly than\nin a tank in a mine, but the point is that such detectors are now well\nwithin the realm of technical feasibility and costs not large compared\nto equivalent scientific endeavors. A different type of neutrino telescope is under construction at the\nSouth Pole, in ice, the AMANDA Project.  It turns out that ice below\nabout 1.4 km depth is quite clear (100 m attenuation length) and bubble\nfree, though optical scattering is still somewhat of a problem (25 m\neffective scattering length).  The experimenters have worked out a\nmethod to use hot water to drill 2 km deep holes, down which they\nlower strings of photomultipliers.  The instruments become permanently\nfrozen-in after about a day, but the cables can be accessed at the\nsurface, so no complex and expensive electronics need be placed in the\ninaccessible holes.  This array is topologically rather like the\nunderwater arrays, turned bottom-side up.  The AMANDA group has\nreported the detection of a few upcoming  neutrino events, a\ndemonstration of feasibility. There have been many discussions about the relative virtues of the\ndeep lake, ocean and ice approaches, and each has attractions and\nliabilities (for example, while the underwater arrays can be retrieved\nfor service or reconfiguration, the local background light is worse\nand the access not easy).  At this time all four (possibly five)\nprojects are making progress and working towards detectors of a few\ntens of thousands of m^2 in a few years.  Hence, it seems likely that\nreal high energy neutrino astronomy with kilometer scale projects is\nstill about a decade away.  Meanwhile, calculations go on, and\nunderground detectors wait patiently or the next galactic supernova.\nIn the very long run, as has been the case with every venture into new\nparts of the electromagnetic spectrum, one can be sure that neutrino\nastronomy will teach us many new and unexpected wonders as we open a\nnew window upon the universe.

The very thing that characterizes a black hole also makes it hard to study: its intense gravity. All the mass in a black hole is concentrated in a tiny region, surrounded by a boundary called the “event horizon”. Nothing that crosses that boundary can return to the outside universe, not even light. A black hole itself is invisible. But astronomers can still observe black holes indirectly by the way their gravity affects stars and pulls matter into orbit. As gas flows around a black hole, it heats up, paradoxically making these invisible objects into some of the brightest things in the entire universe. As a result, we can see some black holes from billions of light-years away. For one large black hole in a nearby galaxy, astronomers even managed to see a ring of light around the event horizon, using a globe-spanning array of powerful telescopes. Our Work Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian scientists participate in many black hole-related projects: Using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to capture the first image of a black hole’s “shadow”: the absence of light that marks where the event horizon is located. The EHT is composed of many telescopes working together to create one Earth-sized observatory , all monitoring the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, leading to the first image ever captured of a black hole. CfA Plays Central Role In Capturing Landmark Black Hole Image Observing supermassive black holes in other galaxies to understand how they evolve and shape their host galaxies. CfA astronomers use telescopes across the entire spectrum of light, from radio waves to X-rays to gamma rays. A Surprising Blazar Connection Revealed Studying the infall of matter — called “accretion” — onto black holes, using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes. In addition, CfA researchers use cutting-edge supercomputers to create theoretical models for the disks and jets of matter that black holes create around themselves. Supermassive Black Hole Spins Super-Fast Hunting for black hole interactions with other astronomical objects. That includes “disruption” events, where black holes tear stars or other objects apart, creating bursts of intense light. Black Hole Meal Sets Record for Length and Size Observing clusters of stars to find intermediate mass black holes, and modeling how they shape their environments. A Middleweight Black Hole is Hiding at the Center of a Giant Star Cluster Hunting for and characterizing stellar mass black holes, which can include information about their birth process and evolution. NASA's Chandra Adds to Black Hole Birth Announcement The Varieties of Black Holes Black holes come in three categories: Stellar Mass Black Holes are born from the death of stars much more massive than the Sun. When some of these stars run out of the nuclear fuel that makes them shine, their cores collapse into black holes under their own gravity. Other stellar mass black holes form from the collision of neutron stars , such as the ones first detected by LIGO and Virgo in 2017. These are probably the most common black holes in the cosmos, but are hard to detect unless they have an ordinary star for a companion. When that happens, the black hole can strip material from the star, causing the gas to heat up and glow brightly in X-rays. Supermassive Black Holes are the monsters of the universe, living at the centers of nearly every galaxy. They range in mass from 100,000 to billions of times the mass of the Sun, far too massive to be born from a single star. The Milky Way’s black hole is about 4 million times the Sun’s mass, putting it in the middle of the pack. In the form of quasars and other “active” galaxies , these black holes can shine brightly enough to be seen from billions of light-years away. Understanding when these black holes formed and how they grow is a major area of research. Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian scientists are part of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, which captured the first-ever image of the black hole: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. Intermediate Mass Black Holes are the most mysterious, since we’ve hardly seen any of them yet. They weigh 100 to 10,000 times the mass of the Sun, putting them between stellar and supermassive black holes. We don’t know exactly how many of these are, and like supermassive black holes, we don’t fully understand how they’re born or grow. However, studying them could tell us a lot about how the most supermassive black holes came to be. Black holes can seem bizarre and incomprehensible, but in truth they’re remarkably understandable. Despite not being able to see black holes directly, we know quite a bit about them. They are … Simple . All three black hole types can be described by just two observable quantities: their mass and how fast they spin. That’s much simpler than a star, for example, which in addition to mass is a product of its unique history and evolution , including its chemical makeup. Mass and spin tell us everything we need to know about a black hole: it “forgets” everything that went into making it. Those two quantities determine how big the event horizon is, and the way gravity affects any matter falling onto the black hole. Compact . Black holes are tiny compared to their mass. The event horizon of a black hole the mass of the Sun would be no more than 6 kilometers across, and the faster it spins, the smaller that size is. Even a supermassive black hole would fit easily inside our Solar System. Powerful . The combination of large mass and small size results in very strong gravity. This gravity is strong enough to pull a star apart if it gets too close, producing powerful bursts of light. A supermassive black hole heats gas falling onto it to temperatures of millions of degrees, making it glow brightly enough in X-rays and other types of radiation to be seen across the universe. Very common . From theoretical calculations based on observations, astronomers think the Milky Way might have as many as a hundred million black holes, most of which are stellar mass. And with at least one supermassive black hole in most galaxies, there could be hundreds of billions of supermassive black holes in the observable universe. Very important . Black holes have a reputation for eating everything that comes by, but they turn out to be messy eaters. A lot of stuff that falls toward a black hole gets jetted away, thanks to the complicated churning of gas near the event horizon. These jets and outflows of gas called “winds” spread atoms throughout the galaxy, and can either boost or throttle the birth of new stars, depending on other factors. That means supermassive black holes play an important role in the life of galaxies, even far beyond the black hole’s gravitational pull. And yes, mysterious . Along with astronomers, physicists are interested in black holes because they’re a laboratory for “quantum gravity”. Black holes are described by Albert Einstein’s general relativity, which is our modern theory of gravity, but the other forces of nature are described by quantum physics. So far, nobody has developed a complete quantum gravity theory, but we already know black holes will be an important test of any proposed theory. The first image of a black hole in human history, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope, showing light emitted by matter as it swirls under the influence of intense gravity. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun and resides at the center of the galaxy M87.

These plates are more than historical curiosities: they provide over a century’s worth of data that can be used by contemporary astronomers to trace how objects in the night sky change over periods from years to decades. For that reason, the DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) team are working to digitize the plates for digital storage and analysis. The process can also lead to new discoveries in old images, particularly of events that change over time, such as variable stars, novas, or black hole flares. 2 GMACS Optical and Infrared Astronomy, Central Engineering GMACS - Moderate Dispersion Optical Spectrograph for the Giant Magellan Telescope is a powerful optical spectrograph that will unlock the power of the Giant Magellan Telescope for research ranging from the formation of stars and planets to cosmology. For Scientists 3 Sensing the Dynamic Universe High Energy Astrophysics, Optical and Infrared Astronomy, Solar, Stellar, and Planetary Sciences, Science Education Department The Sensing the Dynamic Universe (SDU) project creates sonified videos exploring the multitude of celestial variables such as stars, supernovae, quasars, gamma ray bursts and more. We sonify lightcurves and spectra, making the astrophysics of variables and transients accessible to the general public, with particular attention to accessibility for those with visual and/or neurological differences. SDU Website 4 ChaMP (Chandra Multiwavelength Project) and ChaMPlane (Chandra Multiwavelength Plane) Survey High Energy Astrophysics NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory is a groundbreaking space telescope, with abilities beyond anything that came before it. The Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP) and Chandra Multiwavelength Plane (ChaMPlane) Survey exploit those abilities to catalog the variety of X-ray sources within archival Chandra data, with follow-up using other telescopes in other parts of the spectrum of light. The surveys identified previously unknown galaxy clusters, quasars, neutron star binary systems, and other significant astronomical sources both in the plane of the Milky Way — ChamPLane — and beyond the galaxy — ChaMP. ChaMP and ChaMPlane are led by astronomers at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in collaboration with researchers at a number of other institutions in the United States and around the world. 5 Telescopes and Instruments Arcus The most powerful astronomical events are often very bright in X-rays, including supermassive black holes, the hot atmospheres of stars, and the extremely hot plasmas in and around galaxy clusters. Arcus is a proposed NASA space telescope designed to study the X-ray spectrum of a wide range of astronomical phenomena to a level of sensitivity higher than any previous X-ray observatory. Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian scientists are the leaders of the collaboration proposing Arcus. The mission proposal will be due in late 2023 and, if ultimately accepted, Arcus would launch in 2031. See Arcus Website 1 Chandra The Chandra X-ray Observatory is NASA’s flagship X-ray observatory, providing essential data on everything from the environment surrounding newborn stars to the emissions from hot plasma inside galaxy clusters. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), as part of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, manages Chandra’s day-to-day operations, providing spacecraft control, observation planning, and data processing for astronomers. Chandra is one of NASA’s orbiting Great Observatories, along with the Hubble. Visit the Chandra Website 2 Einstein Observatory NASA’s Einstein Observatory was the first X-ray space telescope designed to produce images of astronomical X-ray sources. The spacecraft operated from 1978 through 1981, providing important observations of pulsars, supernova remnants, supermassive black holes in other galaxies, and many more, paving the way for NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. The X-ray telescope was designed by researchers at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. 3 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Black holes are found in the centers of most galaxies, where they can influence star formation and the distribution of atoms in the environment surrounding them. However, direct observation of a black hole is difficult because it is so small relative to their masses. Founded by Shep Doeleman at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first image ever taken of a black hole: specifically, the ring of light produced by matter just as it falls into the black hole at the center of the nearby galaxy M87. The EHT is a virtual observatory consisting of telescopes spanning the planet, from Greenland to the South Pole. The international collaboration operating the EHT includes observatories affiliated with the Center for Astrophysics: the CfA’s Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Greenland Telescope. Visit the EHT Website 4 Large Aperture Experiment to Explore the Dark Ages (LEDA) At some point early in the history of the universe, the first stars were born. However, we don’t know exactly when that was, or what the first generation of stars looked like. The Large Aperture Experiment to Explore the Dark Ages (LEDA) is an observatory designed to solve these mysteries, by looking for light from hydrogen gas when the universe was only about 1% of its current age, to find signs of the earliest stars and black holes. LEDA consists of 512 antennas tuned to the wavelength of radio light emitted by cold hydrogen atoms. These antennas are in two clusters located in California and New Mexico. Visit the LEDA Website 5 The Greenland Telescope The polar regions are challenging environments for humans, but worthwhile for astronomy with their long nights and often-clear skies. The Greenland Telescope is the latest telescope to be placed in the Arctic, as part of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project to capture the first images of black holes. The telescope operates in the region of the spectrum where infrared and radio light meet, which is ideal for looking into the dense central region of the Milky Way, where our galaxy’s supermassive black hole resides. The Greenland Telescope is jointly operated by the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA) of Taiwan. Visit the Greenland Telescope Website 6 Uhuru The Uhuru X-ray Explorer Satellite was the first spacecraft dedicated to X-ray astronomy. During its mission in the early 1970s, Uhuru mapped the X-ray sky. It provided the first observational evidence for black holes, revealed that galaxy clusters contain hot X-ray-emitting gas, and charted the behavior of neutron stars in binary systems. The observatory was named Uhuru, the Swahili word meaning “freedom”, in honor of Kenyan independence and because the rocket carrying the spacecraft was launched into orbit from a site off the coast of Kenya near Mombasa. The success of the Uhuru satellite led the way for all subsequent space telescopes, from the Einstein Observatory to NASA’s flagship Chandra X-ray Observatory. 7 Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) Gamma rays don’t pierce Earth’s atmosphere, but when they strike the air, they produce faint flashes of visible light. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is a set of four telescopes designed to detect those flashes, providing valuable observations of gamma rays from supernova remnants, black holes, and other extremely high-energy astrophysical events.

        "full_text": "continuous waves | Christopher Berry Understanding how stars work is a fundamental problem in astrophysics. We can’t open up a star to investigate its inner workings, which makes it difficult to test our models. Over the years, we have developed several ways to sneak a peek into what must be happening inside stars, such as by measuring solar neutrinos , or using asteroseismology to measure how sounds travels through a star. In this paper , we propose a new way to examine the hearts of stars using gravitational waves. Gravitational waves interact very weakly with stuff. Whereas light gets blocked by material (meaning that we can’t see deeper than a star’s photosphere ), gravitational waves will happily travel through pretty much anything. This property means that gravitational waves are hard to detect, but it also means that there’ll happily pass through an entire star. While the material that makes up a star will not affect the passing of a gravitational wave, its gravity will. The mass of a star can lead to gravitational lensing and a slight deflecting, magnification and delaying of a passing gravitational wave. If we can measure this lensing, we can reconstruct the mass of star, and potentially map out its internal structure. Two types of eclipse: the eclipse of a distant gravitational wave (GW) source by the Sun, and gravitational waves from an accreting millisecond pulsar (MSP) eclipsed by its companion. Either scenario could enable us to see gravitational waves passing through a star. Figure 2 of Marchant et al. (2020) . We proposed looking at gravitational waves for eclipsing sources—where a gravitational wave source is behind a star. As the alignment of the Earth (and our detectors), the star and the source changes, the gravitational wave will travel through different parts of the star, and we will see a different amount of lensing, allowing us to measure the mass of the star at different radii. This sounds neat, but how often will we be lucky enough to see an eclipsing source? To date, we have only seen gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences (the inspiral and merger of two black holes or neutron stars). These are not a good source for eclipses. The chances that they travel through a star is small (as space is pretty empty) [ bonus note ]. Furthermore, we might not even be able to work out that this happened. The signal is relatively short, so we can’t compare the signal before and during an eclipse. Another type of gravitational wave signal would be much better: a continuous gravitational wave signal. Probability of observing at least one eclipsing source amongst a number of observed sources. Compact binary coalescences (CBCs, shown in purple) are the most rare, continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) eclipsed by the Sun (red) or by a companion (red) are more common. Here we assume companions are stars about a tenth the mass of the neutron star. The number of neutron stars with binary companions is estimated using the COSMIC population synthesis code . Results are shown for eclipses where the gravitational waves get within distance of the centre of the star. Figure 1 of Marchant et al. (2020) . Continuous gravitational waves are produced by rotating neutron stars . They are pretty much perfect for searching for eclipses. As you might guess from their name, continuous gravitational waves are always there. They happily hum away, sticking to pretty much the same note (they’d get pretty annoying to listen to). Therefore, we can measure them before, during and after an eclipse, and identify any changes due to the gravitational lensing. Furthermore, we’d expect that many neutron stars would be in close binaries, and therefore would be eclipsed by their partner. This would happen each time they orbit, potentially giving us lots of juicy information on these stars. All we need to do is measure the continuous gravitational wave… The effect of the gravitational lensing by a star is small. We performed detailed calculations for our Sun (using MESA ), and found that for the effects to be measurable you would need an extremely loud signal. A signal-to-noise ratio would need to be hundreds during the eclipse for measurement precision to be good enough to notice the imprint of lensing. To map out how things changed as the eclipse progressed, you’d need signal-to-noise ratios many times higher than this. As an eclipse by the Sun is only a small fraction of the time, we’re going to need some really loud signals (at least signal-to-noise ratios of 2500) to see these effects. We will need the next generation of gravitational wave detectors. We are currently thinking about the next generation of gravitational wave detectors [ bonus note ]. The leading ideas are successors to LIGO and Virgo: detectors which cover a large range of frequencies to detect many different types of source. These will be expensive (billions of dollars, euros or pounds), and need international collaboration to finance. However, I also like the idea of smaller detectors designed to do one thing really well. Potentially these could be financed by a single national lab. I think eclipsing continuous waves are the perfect source for this—instead of needing a detector sensitive over a wide frequency range, we just need to be sensitive over a really narrow range. We will be able to detect continuous waves before we are able to see the impact of eclipses. Therefore, we’ll know exactly what frequency to tune for. We’ll also know exactly when we need to observe. I think it would be really awesome to have a tunable narrowband detector, which could measure the eclipse of one source, and then be tuned for the next one, and the next. By combining many observations, we could really build up a detailed picture of the Sun. I think this would be an exciting experiment—instrumentalists, put your thinking hats on! Let’s reach for(the centres of) the stars. arXiv: 1912.04268 [astro-ph.SR] Journal: Physical Review D ; 101 (2):024039(15); 2020 Data release: Eclipses of continuous gravitational waves as a probe of stellar structure CIERA story: Using gravitational waves to see inside stars Why does the sun really shine? The Sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma Bonus notes Silver lining Since signals from compact binary coalescences are so unlikely to be eclipsed by a star, we don’t have to worry that our measurements of the source property are being messed up by this type of gravitational lensing distorting the signal. Which is nice. Prospects with LISA If you were wondering if we could see these types of eclipses with the space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA , the answer is sadly no. LISA observes lower frequency gravitational waves. Lower frequency means longer wavelength, so long in fact that the wavelength is larger than the size of the Sun! Since the size of the Sun is so small compared to the gravitational wave, it doesn’t leave a same imprint: the wave effectively skips over the gravitational potential.

It is the time of year for applying for academic jobs and so I have been polishing up my CV. In doing so I spotted that I had missed the publication of one of the LIGO Scientific–Virgo Collaboration papers. In my defence, it was published the week of 8–14 February , which saw the publication of one or two other papers [ bonus note ]. The paper I was missing is on a search for continuous gravitational waves. Continuous gravitational waves are near constant hums. Unlike the chirps of coalescing binaries , continuous signals are always on. We think that they could be generated by rotating neutron stars, assuming that they are not perfectly smooth. This is the first search to look for continuous waves from anywhere on the sky with frequencies below 50 Hz. The gravitational-wave frequency is twice the rotational frequency of the neutron star, so this is the first time we’ve looked for neutron stars spinning slower than 25 times per second (which is still pretty fast, I’d certainly feel more than a little queasy). The search uses data from the second and fourth Virgo Science Runs (VSR2 and VSR4): the detector didn’t behave as well in VSR3, which is why that data isn’t used. The frequency of a rotating neutron star isn’t quite constant for two reasons. First, as the Earth orbits around the Sun it’ll move towards and away from the source. This leads to the signal being Doppler shifted. For a given position on the sky, this can be corrected for, and this is done in the search. Second, the neutron star will slow down (a process known as spin-down) because it looses energy and angular momentum. There are various processes that could slow a neutron star, emitting gravitational waves is one, some form of internal sloshing around is another which could also cause things to speed up, or perhaps some braking from its magnetic field. We’re not too sure exactly how quickly spin down will happen, so we search over a range of possible values from to . The particular search technique used is called FrequencyHough . This chops the detector output into different chunks of time. In each we calculate how much power is at each frequency. We then look for a pattern, where we can spot a signal across different times, allowing for some change from spin-down. Recognising the track of a signal with a consistent frequency evolution is done using a Hough transform , a technique from image processing that is good at spotting lines. The search didn’t find any signals. This is not too surprising. Therefore, we did the usual thing of setting some upper limits. The plot below shows 90% confidence limits (that is where we’d expect to detect 9/10 signals) on the signal amplitude at different frequencies. 90% confidence upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain at different frequencies. Each dot is for a different 1 Hz band. Some bands are noisy and feature instrumental artefacts which have to be excluded from the analysis, these are noted as the filled (magenta) circles. In this case, the upper limit only applies to the part of the band away from the disturbance. Figure 12 of Aasi et al . (2016) . Given that the paper only reports a non-detection, it is rather lengthy. The opening sections do give a nice introduction to continuous waves and how we hunt for them, so this might be a good paper is you’re new to the area but want to learn some of the details. Be warned that it does use for some reason. After the introduction, it does get technical, so it’s probably only for insomniacs. However, if you like a good conspiracy and think we might be hiding something, the appendices go through all the details of removing instrumental noise and checking outliers found by the search. In summary, this was the first low-frequency search for continuous gravitational waves. We didn’t find anything in the best data from the initial detector era, but the advanced detectors will be much more sensitive to this frequency range. Slowly rotating neutron stars can’t hide forever. arXiv: 1510.03621 [astro-ph.IM] Journal: Physical Review D ; 93 (4):042007(25); 2016 Science summary: First search for low frequency continuous gravitational waves emitted by unseen neutron stars Greatest regret: I didn’t convince the authors to avoid using “air quotes” around jargon. Bonus note Better late than never I feel less guilty about writing a late blog post about this paper as I know that it has been a long time in the making. As a collaboration, we are careful in reviewing our results ; this can sometimes lead to delays in announcing results, but hopefully means that we get the right answer. This paper took over three years to review, a process which included over 85 telecons!

The most recent, and most sensitive, all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves shows no signs of a detection. These signals from rotating neutron stars remain elusive. New data from the advanced detectors may change this, but we will have to wait a while to find out. This at least gives us time to try to figure out what to do with a detection, should one be made. New years and new limits The start of the new academic year is a good time to make resolutions—much better than wet and windy January. I’m trying to be tidier and neater in my organisation. Amid cleaning up my desk, which is covered in about an inch of papers, I uncovered this recent Collaboration paper , which I had lost track of. The paper is the latest in the continuous stream of non-detections of continuous gravitational waves . These signals could come from rotating neutron stars which are deformed or excited in some way, and the hope that from such an observation we could learn something about the structure of neutron stars. The search uses old data from initial LIGO’s sixth science run. Searches for continuous waves require lots of computational power, so they can take longer than even our analyses of binary neutron star coalescences . This is a semi-coherent search, like the recent search of the Orion spur —somewhere between an incoherent search, which looks for signal power of any form in the detectors, and a fully coherent search, which looks for signals which exactly match the way a template wave evolves [bonus note]. The big difference compared to the Orion spur search, is that this one looks at the entire sky. This makes it less sensitive in those narrow directions, but means we are not excluding the possibility of sources from other locations. Artist’s impression of the local part of the Milky Way. The yellow cones mark the extent of the Orion Spur spotlight search , and the pink circle shows the equivalent sensitivity of this all-sky search. Green stars indicate known pulsars . Original image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESO/R. Hurt . The search identified 16 outliers, but an examination of all of these showed they could be explained either as an injected signal or as detector noise. Since no signals were found, we can instead place some upper limits on the strength of signals. The plot below translates the calculated upper limits (above which there would have been a ~75%–95% chance of us detected the signal) into the size of neutron star deformations. Each curve shows the limits on detectable signals at different distance, depending upon their frequency and the rate of change of their frequency. The dotted lines show limits on ellipticity , a measure of how bumpy the neutron star is. Larger deformations mean quicker changes of frequency and produce louder signals, therefore they can can be detected further away. Range of the PowerFlux search for rotating neutron stars assuming that spin-down is entirely due to gravitational waves. The solid lines show the upper limits as a function of the gravitational-wave frequency and its rate of change; the dashed lines are the corresponding limits on ellipticity, and the dotted line marks the maximum searched spin-down. Figure 6 of Abbott et al . (2016) . Neutron stars are something like giant atomic nuclei. Figuring the properties of the strange matter that makes up neutron stars is an extremely difficult problem. We’ll never be able to recreate such exotic matter in the laboratory. Gravitational waves give us a rare means of gathering experimental data on how this matter behaves. However, exactly how we convert a measurement of a signal into constraints on the behaviour of the matter is still uncertain. I think that making a detection might only be the first step in understanding the sources of continuous gravitational waves. arXiv: 1605.03233 [gr-qc] Journal: Physical Review D ; 94 (4):042002(14); 2016 Other new academic year resolution: To attempt to grow a beard. Beard stroking helps you think, right? Bonus note The semi-coherent search As the first step of this search, the PowerFlux algorithm looks for power that changes in frequency as expected for a rotating neutron star: it factors in Doppler shifting due to the motion of the Earth and a plausible spin down (slowing of the rotation) of the neutron star. As a follow up, the Loosely Coherent algorithm is used, which checks for signals which match short stretches of similar templates. Any candidates to make it through all stages of refinement are then examined in more detail. This search strategy is described in detail for the S5 all-sky search .

A cloudy bank holiday Monday is a good time to catch up on blogging. Following the splurge of GW150914 papers , I’ve rather fallen behind. Published back in February, this paper is a search for continuous-wave signals : the almost-constant hum produced by rapidly rotating neutron stars. Continuous-wave searches are extremely computationally expensive. The searches take a while to do, which can lead to a delay before results are published [ bonus note ]. This is the result of a search using data from LIGO’s sixth science run (March–October 2010). To detect a continuous wave, you need to sift the data to find a signal that present through all the data. Rotating neutron stars produce a gravitational-wave signal with a frequency twice their orbital frequency. This frequency is almost constant, but could change as the observation goes on because (i) the neutron star slows down as energy is lost (from gravitational waves, magnetic fields or some form of internal sloshing around); (ii) there is some Doppler shifting because of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, and, possibly, (iii) the there could be some Doppler shifting because the neutron star is orbiting another object. How do you check for something that is always there? There are two basic strategies for spotting continuous waves. First, we could look for excess power in a particular frequency bin. If we measure something in addition to what we expect from the detector noise, this could be a signal. Looking at the power is simple, and so not too expensive. However, we’re not using any information about what a real signal should look like, and so it must be really loud for us to be sure that it’s not just noise. Second, we could coherently search for signals using templates for the expected signals. This is much more work, but gives much better sensitivity. Is there a way to compromise between the two strategies to balance cost and sensitivity? This paper reposts results of a loosely coherent search. Instead of checking how well the data match particular frequencies and frequency evolutions, we average over a family of similar signals. This is less sensitive, as we get a bit more wiggle room in what would be identified as a candidate, but it is also less expensive than checking against a huge number of templates. We could only detect continuous waves from nearby sources: neutron stars in our own Galaxy. (Perhaps 0.01% of the distance of GW150914). It therefore makes sense to check nearby locations which could be home to neutron stars. This search narrows its range to two directions in the Orion spur, our local band with a high concentration of stars. By focussing in on these spotlight regions, we increase the sensitivity of the search for a given computational cost. This search could possibly dig out signals from twice as far away as if we were considering all possible directions. Artist’s impression of the local part of the Milky Way. The Orion spur connects the Perseus and Sagittarius arms. The yellow cones mark the extent of the search (the pink circle shows the equivalent all-sky sensitivity ). Green stars indicate known pulsars . Original image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESO/R. Hurt . The search found 70 interesting candidates. Follow-up study showed that most were due to instrumental effects. There were three interesting candidates left after these checks, none significant enough to be a detection, but still worth looking at in detail. A full coherent analysis was done for these three candidates. This showed that they were probably caused by noise. We have no detections arXiv: 1510.03474 [gr-qc] Journal: Physical Review D ; 93 (4):042006(14); 2016 Science summary: Scouting our Galactic neighborhood Other bank holiday activities: Scrabble Bank holiday family Scrabble game. When thinking about your next turn, you could try seeing if your letters match a particular word (a coherent search which would get you the best score, but take ages), or just if your letters jumble together to make something word-like (an incoherent search, that is quick, but may result in lots of things that aren’t really words ). Bonus note Niceness The Continuous Wave teams are polite enough to wait until we’re finished searching for transient gravitational-wave signals (which are more time sensitive) before taking up the LIGO computing clusters. They won’t have any proper results from O1 just yet.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration is busy analysing the data we’re currently taking with Advanced LIGO at the moment. However, the Collaboration is still publishing results from initial LIGO too. The most recent paper is a search for continuous waves —signals that are an almost constant hum throughout the observations. (I expect they’d be quite annoying for the detectors). Searching for continuous waves takes a lot of computing power (you can help by signing up for Einstein@Home ), and is not particularly urgent since the sources don’t do much, hence it can take a while for results to appear. Supernova remnants Massive stars end their lives with an explosion, a supernova. Their core collapses down and their outer layers are blasted off. The aftermath of the explosion can be beautiful, with the thrown-off debris forming a bubble expanding out into the interstellar medium (the diffuse gas, plasma and dust between stars). This structure is known as a supernova remnant. The youngest known supernova remnant, G1.9+0.3 (it’s just 150 years old), observed in X-ray and optical light. The ejected material forms a shock wave as it pushes the interstellar material out of the way. Credit: NASA/CXC/NCSU/DSS/Borkowski et al . At the centre of the supernova remnant may be what is left following the collapse of the core of the star. Depending upon the mass of the star, this could be a black hole or a neutron star (or it could be nothing). We’re interested in the case it is a neutron star. Neutron stars Neutron stars are incredibly dense. One teaspoon’s worth would have about as much mass as 300 million elephants. Neutron stars are like giant atomic nuclei. We’re not sure how matter behaves in such extreme conditions as they are impossible to replicate here on Earth. If a neutron star rotates rapidly (we know many do) and has an uneven or if there are waves in the the neutron star that moves lots of material around (like Rossby waves on Earth), then it can emit continuous gravitational waves. Measuring these gravitational waves would tell you about how bumpy the neutron star is or how big the waves are, and therefore something about what the neutron star is made from. Neutron stars are most likely to emit loud gravitational waves when they are young. This is for two reasons. First, the supernova explosion is likely to give the neutron star a big whack, this could ruffle up its surface and set off lots of waves, giving rise to the sort of bumps and wobbles that emit gravitational waves. As the neutron star ages, things can quiet down, the neutron star relaxes, bumps smooth out and waves dissipate. This leaves us with smaller gravitational waves. Second, gravitational waves carry away energy, slowing the rotation of the neutron star. This also means that the signal gets quieter (and harder) to detect as the  neutron star ages. Since young neutron stars are the best potential sources, this study looked at nine young supernova remnants in the hopes of finding continuous gravitational waves. Searching for gravitational waves from particular sources is less computationally expensive than searching the entire sky. The search included Cassiopeia A , which had been previously searched in LIGO’s fifth science run , and G1.9+0.3 , which is only 150 years old, as discovered by Dave Green . The positions of the searched supernova remnants are shown in the map of the Galaxy below. The nine young supernova remnants searched for continuous gravitational waves . The yellow dot marks the position of the Solar System. The green markers show the supernova remnants, which are close to the Galactic plane. Two possible positions for Vela Jr ( G266.2−1.2 ) were used, since we are uncertain of its distance. Original image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESO/R. Hurt . Gravitational-wave limits No gravitational waves were found. The search checks how well template waveforms match up with the data. We tested that this works by injecting some fake signals into the data.  Since we didn’t detect anything, we can place upper limits on how loud any gravitational waves could be. These limits were double-checked by injecting some more fake signals at the limit, to see if we could detect them. We quoted 95% upper limits, that is where we expect that if a signal was present we could see it 95% of the time. The results actually have a small safety margin built in, so the injected signals were typically found 96%–97% of the time. In any case, we are fairly sure that there aren’t gravitational waves at or above the upper limits. These upper limits are starting to tell us interesting things about the size of neutron-star bumps and waves. Hopefully, with data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, we’ll actually be able to make a detection. Then we’ll not only be able to say that these bumps and waves are smaller than a particular size, but they are this size. Then we might be able to figure out the recipe for making the stuff of neutron stars (I think it might be more interesting than just flour and water ). arXiv: 1412.5942 [astro-ph.HE] Journal: Astrophysical Journal ; 813 (1):39(16); 2015 Science summary: Searching for the youngest neutron stars in the Galaxy Favourite supernova remnant: Cassiopeia A Share this: Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Bluesky Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window) Mastodon Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like Loading... A new paper from the LIGO Scientific Collaboration has snuck out. It was actually published back in March but I didn’t notice it, nearly risking my New Year’s resolution . This is another paper on continuous waves from rotating neutron stars, so it’s a little outside my area of expertise. However, there is an official science summary written by people who do know what they’re talking about. The paper looks at detecting gravitational waves from a spinning neutron star. We didn’t find any. However, we have slightly improved our limit for how loud they need to be before we would have detected them, which is nice. Neutron stars can rotate rapidly. They can be spun up if they accrete material from a disc orbiting them. If they neutron star has an asymmetry, if it has a little bump, as it rotates it emits gravitational waves. The gravitational waves carry away angular momentum, which should spin down the neutron star. This becomes more effective as the angular velocity increases. At some point you expect that the spin-up effect from accretion balances the spin-down effect of gravitational waves and you are left with a neutron star spinning at pretty constant velocity. We have some evidence that this might happen, as low-mass X-ray binaries seem to have their spins clustered in a small range of frequencies. Assuming we do have this balance, we are looking for a continuous gravitational wave with constant frequency, a rather dull humming. Scorpius X-1 is the brightest X-ray source in the sky. It contains a neutron star, so it’s a good place to check for gravitational waves from neutron stars. In this case, we’re using data from initial LIGO’s fifth science run (4 November 2005–1 October 2007). This has been done before , but this paper implements some new techniques. I expect that the idea is to test things out ahead of getting data with Advanced LIGO.

Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/S. Immler and H. Krimm. A limit of 10 days’ worth of data is used, as this should be safely within the time taken for the rotational frequency to fluctuate by a noticeable amount due to variation in the amount of accretion. In human terms, that would be the time between lunch and dinner, where your energy levels change because of how much you’ve eaten. They picked data from 21–31 August 2007, as their favourite (it has the best noise performance over the frequency range of interest), and used two other segments to double-check their findings. We’d be able to use more data if we knew how the spin wandered with time. We already know a lot about Scorpius X-1 from electromagnetic observations (like where it is and its orbital parameters). We don’t know its spin frequency, but we might have an idea about the orientation of its spin if this coincides with radio jets. The paper considers two cases: one where we don’t know anything about the spin orientation, and one where we use information from the jets. The results are similar in both cases. As the neutron star orbits in its binary system, it moves back and forth which Doppler shifts the gravitational waves. This adds a little interest to the hum, spreading it out over a range of frequencies. The search looks for gravitational waves over this type of frequency range, which they refer to as sidebands. There are a few events where it looks like there is something, but after carefully checking, these look like they are entirely consistent with noise. I guess this isn’t too surprising. Since they didn’t detect anything, they can only impose an upper limit. This is stronger than the previous upper limit, but only by a factor of about 1.4. This might not sound too great, but the previous analysis used a year of data, whereas this only used 10 days. This method therefore saves a lot on computational time. The result of the paper is quite nice, but not too exciting. If it were a biscuit, it’d probably be a rich tea. It’s nice to have, but it’s not a custard cream. arXiv: 1412.5942 [astro-ph.HE] Journal: Physical Review D ; 91 (6):062008(20); 2015 Science summary: Combing Initial LIGO Data for the Potentially Strong Continuous Wave Emitter Scorpius X-1 Biscuit rating: Rich tea Share this: Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Bluesky Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window) Mastodon Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like Loading...

I am very passionate about the work I do, and working on fostering the next generation of sea ice scientists by advising post-docs and graduate students from the University of Maryland on top of my other roles and research activities. I also love doing education and communication outreach. Research Interests Sea ice atmospheric interactions Earth Science: Sea Ice I aim to understand sea ice -atmospheric interactions in a rapidly changing Arctic using satellite, reanalysis, and models. I am particularly interested in how a loss of sea ice coverage is affecting the local Arctic atmosphere, and also how episodic weather events (cyclones and moisture intrusions) are affecting the survivability of sea ice parcels from year to year. Specifically, using remotely sensed data to study the Arctic sea ice and its interactions with sea surface temperatures, air temperatures and specific humidity. Primary research activities focus on estimating the moisture, latent and sensible heat fluxes of the Arctic sea ice and ocean and improving these measurements over the Arctic sea ice using new parameterizations in the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory model. Expertise in the analysis of various satellite sensor data (e.g. AIRS, SSM/I, AMSR-E, AVHRR).

Selected Public Outreach Arctic Moisture on the Move May 2015 -  Present Scientists such as NASA’s Linette Boisvert want to know how this decline is contributing to a warmer and wetter Arctic. Arctic Climate Change Marked by Warmer Wetter Conditions September 2015 -  Present This causes the Arctic to absorb more sunlight, adding heat to the ocean and causing the increased evaporation, reported Linette Boisvert, a research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. As sea ice shrinks, the Arctic becomes warmer and wetter, study finds September 2015 -  Present November saw the biggest increases in “skin temperature” (defined as temperature at the Earth’s surface), and air temperature, with an average annual rise of 0.42 degrees Celsius on the surface and 0.32 degrees Celsius in the air, said the study, by Linette Boisvert of the NASA-affiliated Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center at the University of Maryland. NSIDC, NASA Say Arctic Melt Season Lengthening, Ocean Rapidly Warming April 2014 -  Present \"If air and ocean temperatures are similar, the ocean is not going to lose heat to the atmosphere as fast as it would when the differences are greater,\" said Linette Boisvert, co-author of the paper and a cryospheric scientist at Goddard. \"In the last years, the upper ocean heat content is much higher than it used to be, so it’s going to take a longer time to cool off and for freeze up to begin.\" Sea Ice Near Greenland September 2015 -  Present February continues streak of record low Arctic sea ice extent - NSIDC Sea Ice News March 2016 - March 2016 Arctic sea ice was at a satellite-record low for the second month in a row. The first three weeks of February saw little ice growth, but extent rose during the last week of the month. Arctic sea ice typically reaches its maximum extent for the year in mid to late March. Extremely Warm 2015-’16 Winter Cyclone Weakened Arctic Sea Ice Pack December 2016 -  Present A large cyclone that crossed the Arctic in December 2015 brought so much heat and humidity to this otherwise frigid and dry environment that it thinned and shrunk the sea ice cover during a time of the year when the ice should have been growing thicker and stronger, a NASA study found.
